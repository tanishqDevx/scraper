Customs, Excise and Gold Tribunal - Delhi
Adarsh Packers (P) Ltd. vs Collector Of Central Excise on 22 March, 1994
Equivalent citations: 1994(71)ELT837(TRI-DEL)
ORDER
S.K. Bhatnagar, Vice President
1. This is a Stay Application filed with reference to the Order-in-Appeal of Collector of Central Excise (Appeals) dated 30-11-1993.
2. The Learned Counsel stated that in this case, the entire consignment was sold by the importer to the appellant on High Sea Sale basis and endorsements to this effect was made on all copies of Bills of Entry. The entire consignment was brought from the Customs House directly to their factory in original packed condition and the modvat credit was taken accordingly.
3. The modvat is however sought to be denied on the ground that this was not permissible.
4. It was their submission that this is a well recognised practice and was permissible under the rules. And in this connection, they would draw attention to the Bombay Collectorate Trade Notice No. 57/1987 dated 7-8-1987.
5. Learned Departmental Representative stated that in view of a series of orders of this Tribunal on this point he does not oppose the request for waiver of pre-deposit and has no objection if Appeal itself is heard and disposed of.
6. Learned Counsel also states that as this is the only point involved he has also no objection if the appeal itself is heard and disposed of.
7. We observe that the assessed Bill of Entry is a document which constitutes proof of payment of duty in respect of the goods mentioned therein; and it is well settled that modvat credit can be availed of on the basis of such documents, particularly in the case of sale on High Sea Sales basis provided that the Bills of Entry are duly endorsed in favour of the purchaser; (and the required certificate /declaration are noted thereon). We therefore, waive the pre-deposit of the amount in question.
8. Further we take the main appeal itself with the consent of both the sides.
9. Since it is already well settled, by a catena of orders of this Tribunal, that modvat can be availed of in the circumstances, noted above, we set aside the impugned orders and accept the appeal.

Customs, Excise and Gold Tribunal - Delhi
The Fairdeal Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd. vs Collector Of Customs on 12 January, 1983
Equivalent citations: 1983ECR284D(TRI.-DELHI), 1983(12)ELT836(TRI-DEL)
ORDER
 

Gouri Shankar Murthy, Member (J)
1. In this proceeding before the Central Government, transferred to the Tribunal and heard as an Appeal pursuant to
Section 131B
of the Customs Act, 1962, the Appellant impugnes the levy of countervailing duty at 20% ad valorem in terms of Item I(iii) of the
Schedule to the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duty) Act, 1955
(hereinafter referred to as the Act) on an imported consignment of Pethidine Hydrochloride.
2. The grounds urged in support of the Appeal, inter alia, are as follows ;
(a) The consignment was imported and not manufactured in India as envisaged in
Section 3
of the Act and there could be no levy of any duty on the imported consignment in question under the Act ;
(b) In any event, the consignment in question was not "dutiable goods" as denned in
Section 2(c)
of the Act, since it did not conform to the description in Item I(iii) of the
Schedule to the Act
. ["medicinal preparation" not containing alcohol but containing narcotic drug or narcotic],
3. We have heard Shri M.V. Rajadhyaksha, Advocate for the Appellant and Mrs. Zutshi for the Respondent at length.
4. The first of the aforesaid grounds would appear to be clearly misconceived. The levy was, in fact, an additional duty (generally known as countervailing duty) in terms of
Section 3
of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 read with the provisions of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act and not one under the latter enactment simpliciter.
5. In terms of
Section 3
of the Customs Tariff Act, an imported article becomes exigible to an additional duty equal to the excise duty for the time being leviable on a like article if produced or manufactured in India. The explanation to the aforesaid provision clarifies that if a like article is not so produced or manufactured, the additional duty shall be equal to the excise duty leviable on the class or description of articles to which the imported article belongs.
6. If, therefore, the imported consignment in question is a medicinal preparation containing narcotic drug or narcotic in terms of the description contained in Item I(iii) of the
Schedule to the Act
, the levy of "additional duty" at the rate specified in the aforesaid item is attracted pursuant to
Section 3
of the Customs Tariff Act, regardless of the fact that it was actually imported and no like article is manufactured in India.
7. The crux of the issue is, thus, if Pethidine Hydrochloride is a "medicinal preparation containing narcotic drug or narcotic" and this brings us to ground No. (2) set out in para 2(b) supra.
8. In a brief compass, the argument for the petitioner was :
(a) in terms of
Section 2(g)
of the Act, "medicinal preparations" includes all drugs, which are a remedy or prescription prepared for internal or external use of human beings or animals and all substances intended to be used for or in the treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals ;
(b) the consignment in question was not a remedy or a prescription prepared for internal or external use of human beings or animals in as much as it cannot be used straightaway without further processing into injections or tablets, etc. ;
(c) nor is it a "substance" in the light of the ratio of the decision of the Supreme Court in A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 665 [(1963)2 SCJ 322 - Chimanlal Jagjivandas Sheth v. State of Maharashtra] wherein construing the definition of "Drug" in
Section 3(b)
of the Drugs Act, 1940 which is in pari-materia with the definition of "medicinal preparations" in the Act, their Lordships had drawn a distinction between "Medicine" and "substances" which are not medicines strictly so-called and held the appropriate meaning of the expression "substances" to be "things" which are other than medicines but are used for or in treatment ;
(d) if, therefore, the imported consignment is neither a "drug"--not being a remedy or prescription-nor a substance, it cannot be a "medicinal preparation" exigible to duty under the Act;
(e) in any view, applying the rule of strict construction of taxing provisions (
A.LR. 1971 S.C.378-Baidyanath Ayurveda Bhavan v. Excise Commissioner, U.P.
), even if the consignment was a "medicinal preparation", unless it contains narcotic drug or narcotic in terms of Item I(iii) of the
Schedule to the Act
, it cannot attract duty. While a "medicinal preparation" containing narcotic like pethidine will attract duty, pethidine hydrochloride (the imported consignment) will not be liable to duty, inasmuch as it is the narcotic itself and cannot be, therefore, a "medicinal preparation" containing a .narcotic.
9. Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, contended that the definition of "medicinal preparations" in
Section 2(g)
of the Act is inclusive of both drugs and substances and "substance" is much wider in its scope and amplitude and include "drugs". She invited our attention to the meanings given to "substance" and "drugs" in the Dictionery of Science & Technology W&R Chambers, 1971 and contended that the consignment in question was a substance falling within the definition of "medicinal preparations" in
Section 2(g)
of the Act and within Item I(iii) of the
Schedule to the Act
since it was a narcotic itself.
10. A "narcotic drug" or "narcotic" had been defined to mean a substance, other than alcohol, which, when swallowed or inhaled by or injected into, a human being, induces drowsiness, sleep, stupefaction or insensibility in the human being and includes alkaloids of opium. [
Section 2(h)
of the Act]. Pethidine Hydrochloride, the imported consignment in question is, indisputably, a "narcotic", used as an analgesic in the form of injections or tablets.
11. A "medicinal preparation", however, had been defined to include-
(i) all drugs which are a remedy or prescription prepared for internal or external use of human being or animals ; and
(ii) all substances intended to be used for in the treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals.
[
Section 2(g)
of the Act]
12. It would follow from an analysis of the aforesaid definitions that a "narcotic drug" or "narcotic" is a "medicinal preparation"-
(a) if a "drug", when put to the internal or external use of human beings or animals-
(i) by itself, as a remedy ; or
(ii) in conjunction with other drugs or substances as in a prepared prescription ; or
(b) as a substance if intended to be used for or in the treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals.
13. In any view, a "narcotic" being a substance, even as per the definition, will qualify to be a "medicinal preparation", if it is intended to be used for or in the treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals. That the imported consignment was intended to be so used is not in controversy. It was, consequently, a "medicinal preparation" within the scope of the meaning given to the said expression in
Section 2(g)
of the Act, even if it is not actually a "drug" being a readymade remedy or prescription.
14. In the Supreme Court case cited [Chimanlal Jagjivandas Sheth v. State of Maharashtra- A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 665], it was "drug" that was defined to include-
(a) medicines for internal or external use of human beings or animals ;
(b) all substances intended to be used for or in treatment, mitigation or prevention of disease in human beings or animals other than medicines ; and
(c) such substances (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body, etc,
15. It is fairly obvious that while the contradistinction in the Supreme Court case was between medicines for internal or external use and substances other than medicines, no such contradistinction would appear to arise between "drugs" and "substances" simpliciter in terms of
Section 2(g)
of the Act, in view of the absence of words specifically excluding "drugs" from "substances". Assuming, however, that "drugs" and "substances" in
Section 2(g)
of the Act have to be mutually exclusive, the definition of "narcotic" in
Section 2(h)
makes it abundantly clear that a "narcotic" is a "substance", if not a "drug". Reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 665 cannot, thus, be of any avail to the Appellant.
16. Even so, ths question remains if the consignment in question was a "medicinal preparation" containing narcotic.
17. While it is true that taxing provisions are to be strictly construed (A.I.R 1971 S.C. 378) it does not appear that there is any warrant to construe item I(iii) of the Schedule in the manner sought for. Once it is held that the imported consignment was a "medicinal preparation", the fact that it was the narcotic itself and not a preparation containing narcotic would hardly appear to matter. Where a "narcotic drug" or "narcotic" by itself qualifies to be a "medicinal preparation" in terms of
Section 2(g)
of the Act, it is difficult to exclude it from the ambit of Item I(iii) of the Schedule while including a "medicinal preparation" containing a narcotic, howsoever small in content.
18. The ordinary dictionary meaning of the word "contain" is "comprise" apart from "include" [Chamber's Twentieth Century Dictionary]. A "medicinal preparation" containing narcotic drug or narcotic can thus be one comprising, may be wholly, of a narcotic drug or narcotic. Thus understood, the absurdity that may arise if Item I(iii) of the Schedule can be applicable to a medicinal preparation with a trace of narcotic however small, and not to another comprising wholly of the narcotic itself, is avoided.
19. In the result, the appeal cannot sustain and is hereby dismissed.

The petitioner is a retired employee of the Kerala State Road

Transport Corporation. He retired on 31-7-2008. He has filed this

writ petition seeking a direction to the respondents to pay to the

petitioner the balance retirement benefits due to him out of turn to

enable him to pay off the housing loan due from him to the 2nd

respondent.
Although, I sympathise with the petitioner, I do not think that

the petitioner's request can be entertained. A Division Bench of this

Court has already held that for the purpose of paying off loans, no out

of turn payment of retirement benefits can be permitted. In the

above circumstances, the writ petition is dismissed.

Gujarat High Court
In This Criminal Revision Application vs Unknown on 6 September, 2011
CRIMINAL REVISION APPLICATION NO. 134 of 1997



  CORAM ; N    N   MATHUR, J
 (11.4.1997)


ORDER
In   this    Criminal Revision Application, the
petitioner has made certain allegations against the
Judicial Magistrate First Class, Baroda, Court No.1.
This cannot be a ground for quashing the order dated
10.4.1997 passed below Exh.23. If the petitioner wants to
make out any case on the basis of malafides on the part
of the Judicial Magistrate, he may apply for transfer of
ithe trial by moving application before the learned
Sessions Judge. It goes without saying that the party
moving for transfer of case on the ground of bias or
imalafides of a Judge makes       the   same   with   all
seriousness.
Learned   Counsel   for   the    petitioner seeks
permission to withdraw this Revision Application with a
view to approach the learned Sessions Judge. Permission
granted. Dismissed as withdrawn.
Date:   11.4.1997(N N MATHUR, J.)

Rajasthan High Court - Jodhpur
Satish Kumar & Anr vs State & Anr on 25 September, 2008
S. B. CRIMINAL MISC. PETITION NO.49/2008
SATISH KUMAR & ANOTHER. V. STATE OF RAJASTHAN & OTHERS.

DATE OF ORDER                       :::                         25-09-2008

                HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE C. M. TOTLA
Mr. P.K.Sharma, for Petitioner (s).
Mr. S. N. Tiwari, PP, for the State.
Mr.Hemant Jain, for Respondents.
Learned counsel for the petitioner              argued that no trunk or
anything is manufactured in the said premises - petitioner is a business
man, doing business, complying with all law and regulations under a valid
license and business is his right as well as means of livelihood. Argued
that business is that of sale of containers like trunk made of metallic
sheets and only work, if carried out, are of removing denting etc. of
such metallic sheet    containers         and that   also by a wooden hammer.
Argued that even as per orders of court below, no manufacturing work
done at other premises and manufacturing establishment is else where.
Stated that due to ill-will, complainant has initiated these proceedings.
Learned counsel for the respondents argued that findings of the
learned Magistrate are based on evidence - admittedly at best business is
that of   selling of metallic containers - even if repaired at large scale
which creates nuisance.
Considered. As per order impugned, petitioners are restrained from
repairing and manufacturing of trunk either in shop or at outer portion.
Clearly only manufacture        and repair is prohibited. Specifically it is
mentioned that business       can be carried. The order, as above, is very
clear and reasoned one - no interference             by invoking the provisions of
Section 482
, Cr.P.C., is called for.
The petition is dismissed.

Madras High Court
G. Gopalakrishnan And Anr. vs Deputy Commissioner Of Commercial ... on 15 September, 1987
Equivalent citations: [1988]70STC293(MAD)
JUDGMENT



 

  M.N. Chandurkar, C.J.
1. These appeals are admitted.
2. These appeals are against the interim orders vacating the injunction earlier issued with a further observation by the learned Judge that in the event of the petitioners-appellants apprehending that they are likely to be arrested, it is open to them to move the appropriate authorities to show that they are not liable to be arrested.
3. The relief sought in the two writ petitions was that respondents 1 to 3 should be restrained by a writ of mandamus from causing the arrest and detention of the petitioners-appellants in a civil person for default in payment of sales tax. The apprehension appears to be that the authorities are taking action to arrest the two petitioners-appellants without following the prescribed procedure.
4. The writ petitions themselves can be disposed of in view of the fair attitude taken by the Additional Government Pleader (Taxes). He is not in a position to dispute that before an order of arrest is made, the provisions under
section 48
of the Revenue Recovery Act will have to be followed. Section 48 prescribes certain pre-conditions before an order of arrest and imprisonment of the defaulter can be made. The pre-condition is that the arrears due from the defaulter cannot be liquidated by the sale of the property of the defaulter, or of his surety and further that the Collector shall have reason to believe that the defaulter or his surety is wilfully withholding payment of the arrears, or has been guilty of fraudulent conduct in order to evade payment. Unless these ingredients are established, the drastic power of arrest under section 48 cannot be exercised. It is implicit in the provisions of section 48 that the defaulter must have an opportunity to show that he is not willfully withholding payment of the arrears or that he is not guilty of fraudulent conduct in order to evade payment. In order to ascertain the truth or otherwise of these pleas which the defaulter is entitled to take, it is necessary for the Collector to make necessary enquiries after issuing notice to the defaulter. Unless the procedure which is implicit in the provisions of
section 48

                  Dated this the 1st day of December   2006


                                         O R D E R
The   petitioner   is   the   second   accused   in   two   identical


prosecutions   initiated   by   the   respondent   through   its   excise   officials


under   Section   57(a)   of   the   Kerala   Abkari   Act.     The   petitioner   is   the


licensee   in   respect   of   toddy   shops   No.14   and   15   of   Pathanapuram


Excise Range.   On 03/01/2001, at different points of time, the excise


officials   went   to   shops   14   and   15   of   which   the   petitioner   is   the


licensee and drew samples of toddy, which was kept for sale.  Samples


of   toddy   collected   were   sent   to   the   chemical   examiner   and   the


chemical   examiner   submitted   reports,   which   showed   that   the   toddy


samples contained 8.69% and   9.79% of ethyl alcohol.
2.     Crime   was   registered  and  final   report   was   filed  on   these


precise   allegations.     The   learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner   submits


that   even   if   the   entire   allegations   were   accepted,   no   offence   under


Section 57(a) of the Kerala Abkari Act will be revealed in as much as


presence of ethyl alcohol in toddy is perfectly justified and there is no


upper limit of the ethyl  alcohol prescribed under any  of the relevant


rules at the relevant point of time.  Rule 9 of the Kerala Abkari Shops


Disposal   Rules   2002   was   not  in  force  at   the  relevant  time  and  there


was no specific embargo against the upper limit of ethyl alcohol which
Crl.M.C.No.1202/04 & 1203/04                 2
could be found to be present in the toddy offered for sale.  In as much


as   ethyl   alcohol   cannot   be   said   to   be   a   foreign   substance   in   toddy,


Section   57(a)   cannot   have   any   application,   it   is   contended.     The


learned   counsel   for   the   petitioner     points   out   that   paragraph   6(a)


Chapter   5   volume   2   of   the   Kerala   Excise   Manual   suggests   that   in


fermented   liquor   like   toddy,   presence   of   ethyl   alcohol   upto   12%   is


perfectly   legal.     In   these   circumstances,   the   learned   counsel   for   the


petitioner submits that in any view  of the matter, these prosecutions


are liable to be quashed in as much as the allegations raised even if


accepted in toto, do not reveal any culpable offence.
3.      The   learned  counsel   for   the   petitioner     was   requested   to


take   instructions.     The   learned   Public   Prosecutor,   after   taking


instructions, concedes that at the relevant point of time, there was no


stipulation of law which prescribed that   presence of ethyl alcohol in


toddy   to   an   extent   of   8.69%   and   9.79%   is   an   offence.     There   is   no


allegation   that   the   alcohol   found   present   was   not   self   generated   or


was   added   to   toddy.     The   learned   Public   Prosecutor   does   not   make


any attempt to support the charge.
4.      It   follows   from   the   above   discussions   that   the   petitioner


does not deserve to stand in trauma of these prosecutions any further.
Crl.M.C.No.1202/04 & 1203/04            3
5.    These   Crl.M.Cs   are   in   these   circumstances   allowed.     All


further   proceedings   in   pursuance   of   crime   Nos.43/01   and   44/01   of


Pathanapuram   excise   range   against   the   petitioner   are   hereby


quashed.

Allahabad High Court
Ram Narain And Company vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax on 31 July, 1986
Equivalent citations: [1987]67STC422(ALL)
JUDGMENT
 

 Anshuman Singh, J.
1. This revision has been preferred by the assessee against the judgment dated January 27, 1986, passed by the Sales Tax Tribunal, Varanasi Bench-I, Varanasi, relating to assessment year 1977-78, dismissing the appeal of the assessee. The question raised by Mr. Saran Behari Lal Srivastava before me on behalf of the assessee in the present revision is :
Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in rejecting the books of account on the lone ground that the Surveying Officer was not able to account the cash in till at the time of survey dated 16th July, 1977 ?
2. Mr. Saran Behari Lal submitted that the only ground on which the books of account of the assessee have been rejected is that the Surveying Officer was not able to count the cash in till at the time of survey dated 16th July, 1977, and on that ground alone the books of account of the assessee could not be rejected. Mr. Lal has not cited any authority which specifically says that the books of account of an assessee cannot be rejected on the ground that the Surveying Officer was not able to count the cash in till at the time of survey. On the contrary, Mr. Rakesh Ranjan Agarwal, appearing for the Revenue, invited my attention to a decision of this Court in Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. v. Narang Ram Chiranji Lal 1970 UPTC 663, in which it was held that where the assessee does not allow the Surveying Officer, at the time of survey, to verify the cash in his till it creates a suspicion in his mind that the money in the till was not in accordance with the accounts maintained by the assessee and rejected the books of account. In view of the said fact, I am of the opinion that the books of account of the assessee could be rejected on the ground that the assessee did not allow the Surveying Officer to count the cash in the till at the time of survey dated 16th July, 1977. The question is answered in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.
3. As regards the quantum of turnover Mr. Lal has not been able to point out any material which may indicate that the turnover is either excessive or arbitrary.
4. No other question has been raised which may require consideration by this Court in the instant revision.
5. In the result the revision fails and is accordingly rejected. However, there will be no order as to costs.

-.-
Present:- Mr. Sunil Nehra, Addl. A.G., Haryana
          for the petitioner.
Mr. Manoj Kumar, Advocate for respondent No.1.
HEMANT GUPTA, J

          The challenge in the present writ petition is to the Award passed

by the Labour Court on 05.06.2006 (Annexure P-5), whereby an Industrial

Dispute raised by respondent No.1 (hereinafter referred to as "the

workman") was answered in favour of the workman and the workman has

been ordered to be reinstated in service with continuity of service and other

consequential benefits including 50% back wages from the date of issuance

of demand notice till the date of publication of the Award and full wages

thereafter till reinstatement.
It is the case of the workman that he was engaged as a Beldar

w.e.f. December, 1992 on daily wage basis and continued to work till

26.8.2000. The workman claims to have worked for 240 days in a year
C.W.P. No.17851 of 2007                                                -2-
preceding the date of termination. It is alleged that his services have been

terminated on 27.8.2000 without complying with the provisions of
Section

25-F
of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short 'the Act') and also the

provisions of
Section 25-G
of the Act has been violated, as the Management

has retained persons junior to the petitioner.
The stand of the Management was that the workman was engaged

to carry out plantation work which is of seasonal nature. It was denied that

the workman has worked for 240 days in a calendar year.
The learned Labour Court answered reference in favour of the

workman by raising adverse inference against the Management for not

producing the record of the engagement of the workman. It was found that

though the Management witness Dalip Singh, Range Forest Officer, MW-1,

has stated in the cross-examination that he has seen the original muster rolls

from July, 1993 to August, 2000 before appearing as a witness. But, still he

has not produced the records. The learned Labour Court has returned a

finding that the workman has worked for more than 240 days preceding one

year from the date of termination.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied placed upon a

decision of the Supreme Court in cases reported as
Ghaziabad

Development Authority & another Vs. Ashok Kumar & another
, 2008

(
4) SCC 261, Mahboob Deepak vs. Nagar Panchayat
,
Gajraula,

(2008) 1 SCC 575, M.P. Administration Vs. Tribhuwan

, (

SCC (L&S) 813, State of M.P. And others Vs. Lalit Kumar Verma
,

(2007) 1 SCC 575, to contend that the post under the State are required to
C.W.P. No.17851 of 2007                                               -3-
be filled up in terms of the Recruitment Rules and by inviting applications

from all eligible candidates. It is contended that the respondent-workman

was engaged on daily wages without following the rules and principles of
Articles 14
and
16
of the Constitution, therefore, even if the workman has

completed 240 days of service, the said workman is not entitled to be

reinstated and also for the grant of back wages. In M.P. Administration's

case (supra), the Court held to the following effect:-
6.    "The question, however, which arises for consideration is as
          to whether in a situation of this nature, the learned Single Judge
          and consequently the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court
          should have directed reinstatement of the respondent with full
          back wages. Whereas at one point of time, such a relief used to be
          automatically granted, but keeping in view several other factors
          and in particular the doctrine of public employment and
          involvement of the public money, a change in the said trend is
          now found in the recent decisions of this Court. This Court in a
          large number of decisions in the matter of grant of relief of the
          kind distinguished between a daily wager who does not hold a
          post and a permanent employee. It may be that the definition of
          "workman" as contained in
Section 2(s)
of the Act is wide and
          takes within its embrace all categories of workmen specified
          therein, but the same would not mean that even for the purpose of
          grant of relief in an industrial dispute referred for adjudication,
          application of constitutional scheme of equality adumbrated under
Articles 14
and
16
of the Constitution of India, in the light of a
          decision of a Constitution Bench of this Court in
Secy., State of
          Karnataka v. Umadevi
and other relevant factors pointed out by
          the Court in a catena of decisions shall not be taken into
          consideration.
7.    The nature of appointment, whether there existed any
          sanctioned post or whether the officer concerned had any
C.W.P. No.17851 of 2007                                                 -4-
authority to make appointment are relevant factors."
The said observations are in the context of engagement of a

workman engaged on temporary basis from time to time. It was held that

the Industrial Court exercises its discretionary jurisdiction under
Section

11A
of the Act, when it directs the amount of compensation to be paid to the

workman.
In
Mahboob Deepak
's case (supra), the Court held to the

following effect:-
9.     "Due to some exigency of work, although recruitment on
           daily wages or on an ad hoc basis was permissible, but by reason
           thereof an employee cannot claim any right to be permanently
           absorbed in service or made permanent in absence of any statute
           or statutory rules. Merely because an employee has completed
           240 days of work in a year preceding the date of retrenchment, the
           same would not mean that his services were liable to be
           regularised."
In
Ghaziabad Development Authority
's case (supra), the dispute

referred to the Labour Court was regarding termination of daily wagers

appointed on ad hoc basis. It was held to the following effect:-
19.       "A statutory authority is obligated to make recruitments
           only upon compliance with the equality clause contained in
Articles 14
and
16
of the Constitution of India. Any appointment
           in violation of the said contitutional scheme as also the statutory
           recruitment rules, if any, would be void.        These facts were
           required to the kept in mind by the Labour Court before passing
           an award of reinstatement.
20.       Furthermore, public interest would not be subserved if
           after such a long lapse of time, the first respondent is directed to
           be reinstated in service."
C.W.P. No.17851 of 2007                                              -5-
Since the workman has no proof to have worked continuously as

claimed by the workman, therefore, we are of the opinion that the workman

is neither entitled to be reinstated or any back wages.
In view of the above, we allow the present writ petition and the

impugned award dated 05.06.2006 (Annexure P-5), is set aside.

JUDGMENT
 

C.N. Ramachandran Nair, J.
1. The short question arising in these connected tax revision cases pertaining to two assessees is whether they are liable to pay purchase tax under
Section 5A
of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, 1963, hereinafter called "the Act" on the purchase turnover of red oil which was converted by them in their factory to sandalwood oil and sold by them as such. The assessments pertain to the years 1989-90 to 1995-96. Since the main order of the Tribunal is produced in T.R.C. No. 419 of 2000 the facts referred to in the said T.R.C. are considered by us for our decision. In fact all the subsequent orders of the Tribunal are based on their order produced in T.R.C. No. 419 of 2000.
2. The assessees were admittedly engaged in massive purchase of red oil from unregistered dealers who have not collected or remitted any sales tax on their sales to the assessees. Red oil is manufactured out of sandalwood, source of which is only forest in Kerala and Karnataka. In fact the assessing officer rightly pointed out that layman from whom assessees claimed to have purchased red oil cannot produce and sell the same because red oil can be extracted from sandalwood through an elaborate process which could be done in a factory. It is a notorious fact that accounted sandalwood oil production has no relation to the quantity of sandalwood sold by the Forest Department and instances of theft of sandalwood from forest with the patronage of Government officials and production of oil from it in factories run clandestinely in Kerala were hitting the headlines of newspapers. Even though enquiry could have been conducted and assessees should have been made to disclose the identity of persons who supplied red oil to them, failing which the source of red oil could have been attributed to the very same assessees, the assessing officer even after doubting the genuineness of the transactions accepted the purchases and levied tax under
Section 5A
of the Act on the purchase turnover of red oil on the ground that the assessees have consumed red oil in the manufacture of their final product, namely, sandalwood oil. The case of the assessees is that the process of manufacture of sandalwood oil is only removal of impurities and water from red oil by heating it. However, it is admitted fact that assessees have established factories and used steam generated in boilers for heating the raw material, namely, red oil to make sandalwood oil.
It is also conceded that assessees are registered under the
Central Excise Act
and are remitting excise duty on the manufactured product, namely, sandalwood oil. The main reason for the first appellate authority for holding that there is manufacture of product is the payment of excise duty by the assessees. The contention of the assessees before the Tribunal was that there was no chemical use in the manufacture and all what is achieved in the process engaged in the factory is removal of impurities and water from red oil. The assessees relied on several decisions including that of the Supreme Court in
Tungabhadra Industries Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer
[1960] 11 STC 827. The Tribunal accepted the contentions of the assessees and held that there was no manufacture of a new product as the process involved did not involve use of any chemical and all what the assessees have done is removal of impurities and water from red oil.
3. We have heard Special Government Pleader appearing for the State-revision petitioner in all the cases, and Senior Counsel Sri. C. Natarajan, appearing for the assessees. While theSpecial Government Pleader contended that process done in the factory of the assessees amounts to manufacture of a new product, namely, sandalwood oil, from the raw material, that is, red oil and relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in
Assistant Commissioner (Intelligence) v. Nandanam Construction Co.
[1999] 115 STC 427 and the Division Bench decision of this Court in
State of Kerala v. Cochin Shipyard Limited
. Counsel for the assessees advanced the same contentions that were raised by them before the Tribunal.
4. So far as the controversy on manufacturing process, we do not think the contention of the assessees that the process involved is simple removal of water and impurities from the red oil is acceptable because if the process is so simple, we see no reason why a factory with equipments and boilers should be established for this process. The minimum process engaged as evident from the admitted facts is steam distillation of red oil to separate water and sandalwood oil as the raw material is a mix of both. No doubt red oil which is a crude product distilled from sandalwood is still a raw material used for the manufacture of sandalwood oil and it is not a product fit for any application. Therefore red oil, the raw material, and sandalwood oil, the final product, are commercially different. There is substantial value difference between the raw material and the final product which is evident from the purchase value accounted by the assessees for raw material and the value of the final product received by them on sale. Even though assessees contention that manufacture under the
Excise Act
is not the same as manufacture under
Section 5A
of the Act, which found acceptance with the Tribunal, we are unable to uphold the claim of the assessees upheld by the Tribunal, because assessees have not made any claim that excise duty is paid by them without any dispute by virtue of any special provision in the
Excise Act
providing for duty in respect of any other activity other than manufacturing in this case. Even though counsel for the assessees relied on large number of decisions of the Supreme Court and High Courts particularly in
Alladi Venkateswarlu v. Government of Andhra Pradesh
;
Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax (Law), Board of Revenue (Taxes), Ernakulam v. Pio Food Packers
;
State of Tamil Nadu v. Subbaraj and Co.
;
Chowgule & Co. Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India
;
Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. v. Prag Ice and Oil Mills

Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, Ernakulam v. Mohan Jewellery

;
Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Kunhalavi & Co.
;
Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Mohan Jewellery
and
Anwarkhan Mahboob Co. v. State of Bombay
, we do not find any decision directly applicable to the facts of this case.
In fact Supreme Court has, though in the context of the
Income-tax Act
in
Aspinwall and Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax
case , held that just removal of husk/covering from coffee berry to separate coffee beans is a manufacturing activity. Apart from this decision, in large number of decisions, the Supreme Court has held that the process of making goods commercially different from raw material with distinct name, character and use, amounts to manufacture of a product.
Moreover, the scope of purchase tax liability under
Section 6A
of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act which is the same as
Section 5A
of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act, is explained by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the decision in
Assistant Commissioner (Intelligence) v. Nandanam Construction Company
reported in [1999] 115 STC 427. In
the said decision
, the Supreme Court has held that once the goods purchased by the dealer are used in construction and cease to be available in that form for sale or purchase again to attract tax, the liability for purchase tax is attracted.
This decision is followed by a Division Bench of this Court in
State of Kerala v. Cochin Shipyard Limited
wherein this Court upheld the levy of purchase tax on the purchase turnover of water by Cochin Shipyard Ltd., though water purchased was not consumed in the manufacture of any commodity. In fact it is to be noted that by the 1989 amendment
Section 5A
was amended to bring within the scope of purchase tax, items purchased from unregistered dealers without payment of tax for "use".
Section 5A
with it's amendment is extracted hereunder for easy reference:
5A. Levy of purchase tax.--(1) Every dealer who, in the course of his business, purchase from a registered dealer or from any other person any goods, the sale or purchase of which is liable to tax under this Act, in circumstances in which no tax is payable under Sub-sections (1), (3), (4) or (5) of
Section 5
and either,-
(a) consumes such goods in the manufacture of other goods for sale or otherwise; or
(b) uses or disposes of such goods in any manner other than by way of sale in the State; or
(c) despatches them to any place outside the State except as a direct result of sale or purchase in the course of inter-State trade or commerce; shall, whatever be the quantum of the turnover relating to such purchase for a year, pay tax on the taxable turnover relating to such purchase for the year at the rates mentioned in
Section 5
.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1), a dealer (other than a casual trader or agent of a non-resident dealer) purchasing goods, the sale of which is liable to tax under
Section 5
, shall not be liable to pay tax under Sub-section (1) if his total turnover for a year is less than two lakh rupees.
5. From Clause (a) of
Section 5A(1)
above, it is clear that liability is attracted when goods purchased are consumed in the manufacture of other goods for sale. Since we have found above that assessees have purchased raw material, namely, red oil and have consumed the same in the manufacture of sandalwood oil sold by them as final product, liability is attracted on the purchase turnover of red oil under
Section 5A(1)(a)
of the Act. Assuming that assessees' contention that there is no consumption as such of red oil in the manufacture of sandalwood oil is correct, it is admitted that red oil which has not suffered tax has ceased to exist after the same is used up in the manufacture of sandalwood oil and therefore liability in any case is attracted under
Section 5A(1)(b)
of the Act, because use or disposal of the item purchased in any other manner other than by way of sale in the State also attracts liability. As held by the Supreme Court in
the above decision
, the object of the Section is to rope in liability when the item purchased has not been subjected to any tax until it's purchase and the item ceases to exist after it's use by purchasing dealer. Assessees case itself is that suppliers are unregistered dealers and red oil purchased by them has not suffered any tax and after red oil is used by them in the production of sandalwood oil, it ceases to exist. Therefore, if purchase tax is not levied at the hands of the assessees, the same will frustrate and defeat the purpose of
Section 5A
of the Act.
6. We do not know on what basis the Tribunal has assumed that in order to attract liability under
Section 5A
manufacture of a product should be done with the use of chemicals. We are constrained, to observe that the finding of the Tribunal is patently absurd and perverse.
7. We therefore allow the tax revision cases, reversing the orders of the Tribunal, upholding levy of tax under
Section 5A
of the Act on the purchase turnover of red oil by respondents-assessees for all the years.

JUDGMENT
 

  K.M. Natarajan, J.
1. The accused in S.C. No. 119 of 1986 on the file of the II Additional Sessions Judge, Tirunelveli, has preferred this appeal challenging the legality and correctness of the conviction under S. 302 read with
S. 34
I.P.C. and sentence of life imprisonment and also under
S. 324
, I.P.C. and sentence of rigorous imprisonment for one year both the sentences to run concurrently.
2. The appellant was tried for the above two charges on the allegation that on 27-4-1985 at or about 9.15 a.m. at Meenakshipuram, he along with three others caused the death of the deceased Natarajan alias Subbiah-A1 stabbing him on the chest as well as the hip with aruval while A2 attacking him with tharangu on the right arm and during the course of the same transaction the appellant, who is A1, cut P.W. 1 Gurusami with aruval on his left hand above the wrist and caused a simple injury. To substantiate the above two charges the prosecution examined P.Ws. 1 to 7, filed Exs. P1 to P17 and marked M.Os. 1 to 8.
3. The case of the prosecution as disclosed from the oral and documentary evidence can be succinctly stated as follows :
A1 and A2 are brothers and sons of A3. A4 is the brother of A3. The deceased is one Natarajan alias Subbiah. P.W. 5 and the deceased are stepbrothers born through the same father. P.W. 5 married P.W. 1's eldest sister. P.W. 6 is the wife of P.W. 1. They are all residents of Meenakshipuram village. In the year 1981 there was a competition with regard to Kabadi game at Meenakshipuram in which A2 was successful and he defeated the deceased. It is further stated that A1 and A2, on account of a quarrel, beat the deceased Natarajan. This was witnessed by P.Ws. 1 and 5. A few days later, the deceased stabbed A2 with a knife. In respect of the same a complaint was given to Eppothum Vendran Police station and a case was registered in Crime No. 2 of 1981 under
S. 324
I.P.C., and the deceased was prosecuted and he was convicted. It is further stated that on appeal he was acquitted. After the said case, the deceased left the village and was staying at Virudunagar and was employed as a taxi driver and he used to come twice or thrice in a month to the village since his family was at Meenakshipuram. It is the further case of the prosecution that the deceased came to the village on the day of occurrence 27-4-1985, and he along with P.Ws. 1 to 5 was heaping hayrick and they used a plank for the said purpose. At that time P.W. 4. came there. A little later, A1 came there armed with a kozhival aruval and called P.W. 6 to accompany him to the house of his master Kumar in order to receive the wages. At that time, the deceased found fault with A1 for having brought the aruval there and questioned him. A1 was murmuring and left the place. After completing the work, P.Ws. 1, 4 and 6 and others left the place for taking their meals. P.W. 1 and the deceased, after taking coffee in the house of Aruna chalam, who is none other than the father-in-law of the deceased and after staying there for some time, were proceeding to answer calls of nature. While they were proceeding from south to north A1 to A4 came in opposite direction and at that time A1 was armed with aruval and A2 with kuthu tharangu. A2 instigated the other accused to cut and kill the deceased and so A2 shouted by saying that the deceased had come and he should be cut and killed and so saying he stabbed the deceased on his right arm with kuthu tharangu. A1 cut him with aruval on the chest forcefully. At that time P.W. 1 beat A1 with a plank which he was having on the back and broke it into pieces which are marked as M.Os. 1 and 2. Immediately A1 cut P.W. 1 above the left wrist once. A3 threw a stone on the chest of P.W. 1. In the meantime, after receipt of the injury the deceased went to a distance of 4 Bagams (8 yards) and caught hold of the wall and standing. A1 ran towards him and also cut him across the hip twice with aruval. On receipt of the injury the deceased fell down. Thereupon the accused ran away with the respective weapons. P.Ws. 1 and 3 went near the deceased and found him dead. It was at the time 9.15 a.m. A little later, P.W. 4 came there. P.Ws. 1 to 3 requested him to inform P.W. 5 about the occurrence and give a report. Accordingly P.W. 5 took a cycle and met P.W. 5 who was working in the field. P.W. 5 went to Pasuvanthanai police station with the same cycle directly and reached there at about 10.45 a.m. and reported that his younger brother Natarajan alias Subbian was murdered when A1 cut him with aruval and A2 stabbed him with kuthu tharangu and he got the information through P.W. 4. P.W. 14 entered the same in the General Diary in the station. Thereupon, he, along with the constables, went to the Meenakshipuram police station and thereupon to the scene place at about 11 a.m. He recorded a statement, Ex. P1, from P.W. 1 attested by P.W. 5. Thereupon he sent P.W. 1, with a memo to the Government Hospital, Tuticorin and returned to the police station at 12.45 p.m. and on the basis of Ex. P1 complainant registered a case in Crime No. 14 of 1985 under
sections 302
and
324
, I.P.C. and prepared the first information report Ex. P14 and the copies thereon. He sent Exs. P1 and P14 express report though P.W. 2 to the Judicial II Class Magistrate, Kovilpatti and a copy of the same through P.W. 13 to the Inspector of Police of Ottapidaram, who was in charge of that circle. P.W. 16, who was Inspector of Police (Crimes.) Pudukottai and who was in charge of Ottapidaram circle got information through V.H.S. about the case about 12.40 p.m. from P.W. 14. Thereupon he left Ottapidaram and was proceeding along Pasuvandhanai where he got the copy of Ex. P14 and P.W. 13 at about 1.15 p.m. and he took up investigation. He reached the scene place at 1.30 p.m. inspected the same in the presence of P.W. 8, prepared an observation mahazar, Ex. P2 at about 2 p.m. and drew a rough sketch, Ex. P16 and at about 2.45 p.m. he sent constables to search for the accused. Between 3 and 6 p.m. he held inquest over the dead body of Natarajan alias Subbiah and during the inquest he held inquest over the dead body of Natarajan alias Subbiaih and during the inquest he examined P.Ws. 2 to 5. Ex. P17 is the inquest report he examined prepared by him. After completing the inquest he entrusted the dead body with P.W. 13 constable along with a requisition Ex. P6 to the Medical Officer to conduct autopsy. At 6.45 p.m. he seized the bloodstained earth, M.O. 5 from the place where the dead body was found lying, under Ex. P3 attested by P.W. 8. At about 7 p.m. in front of the Agricultural Seva Sangam he seized M.O. 6 blood-stained earth and M.O. 7 sample earth under cover of a mahazar Ex. P4. He also seized M.O. 1 under cover a mahazar Ex. P5 from the pial of A3's house in the presence of P.W. 8. He examined P.W. 7 to 9 p.m. At that time he produced another broken piece of the plank and he seized the same. P.W. 10 is the Medical Officer attached to the Government Hospital, Tuticorin. He examined P.W. 1 at about 2.30 p.m. on 27-4-1985 for certain injured said to have been caused on 27-4-1985 at 9.15 a.m. and it could be due to cut with an aruval. She noticed the following injury on P.W. 1 :
"Incised wound 4" x 3" x 2" on the posterior aspect of left arm in the middle, underlying muscles hanging. Bone is exposed"
According to her, the above injury is simple in nature and could have been caused due to cut with aruval. She further stated that P.W. 1 was admitted as an in-patient and he was an in-patient till 16-5-1985. Ex. P8 is the wound certificate issued by her. Ex. P9 is the extract of the entries made in the accident register.
4. P.W. 9 is the Assistant Surgeon attached to the Government Hospital, Ottapidaram. In pursuance of the requisition he received from P.W. 16 he conducted autopsy of the dead body of the deceased Natarajan alias Subbiah at about 9 a.m. on 28-4-1985 and he found the following injuries :
1. Incised wound over back of right shoulder of 1" x 1" x 1" deltoid muscle fibres cut.
2. An oblique incised wound of 8" x 3" x 4" extending from above the medial end of left clavicle across the chest up to right nipple.
3. Transverse incised wound extending from right loin to left renal ankle of 9" x 3" x 6".
4. Transverse incised wound of 8" x 4" x 6" extending from lower left loin to back of right lumber region.
Internal examination (1) The medial end of left clavicle, manubrium sterna-medial end of right 3rd and 4th ribs and cartileges are served. Transverse part of arch of Aorta served. Trachea and oesophagus served. Right lung; (2) Incised wound of 1" x 1" x 1" over the annterior border. Haemothorax of 200 ml of dark fluid blood in right plaural cavity.
3. Spinal column and canda equina are served at L2 level. The abdominal aorta and I.V.C. severed. Right kidney severed into two equal halves at the level of hylum severing the right renal artery and vein. Peritonium opened.
4. Spinal column and candy equina are severed at L4 level. Abdominal aorta and I.V.C. severed. Peritonium opened. The terminalilum, transverse column and sigmoid colon are protruding out (intact). Heart : chambers empty and pale. Stomach : empty. Rectum and urinary bladder empty. Hyoid bone and atlas axis intact.
He was of the opinion that the deceased would appear to have died of shock and haemorrhage due to injuries sustained about 24 hours prior to autopsy. Ex. P7 is the post-mortem certificate. P.W. 9 was of the further opinion that injury No. 1 noticed by him could have been caused due to stab with a sharp edged weapon like a kuthu tharangu at about 9.15 a.m. It is possible that the injuries 2, 3 and 4 are possible by cutting with an aruval. He was of the further opinion that the external injuries 2 to 4 with the corresponding internal injuries are necessarily fatal and after receipt of the injuries he should have met with the imminent death.
5. P.W. 16 continued further investigation and he examined certain witnesses on 30-4-1985. On 3-5-1985 he gave a requisition to the judicial Magistrate to record
S. 164
, Cr.P.C. statement of the witnesses P.Ws 2 and 3. A1, A3 and A4 surrendered before the Judicial Magistrate, Nanguneri on 30-4-1985 and he got information only on 7-5-1985 and A2 surrendered before the Judicial, II Class Magistrate, No. 1, Tirunelveli on 4-5-1985. P.W. 17 took up further investigation. He verified the investigation already done by P.W. 16 and he gave Ex. P. 10 to the court to send the blood-stained articles for chemical analysis. P.W. 11 is the Head-Clerk attached to the Judicial II Class Magistrate's Court Kovilpatti. It is his evidence that in pursuance of Ex. P10 received from P.W. 17 the material objects were sent for chemical analysis along with the original of Ex. A11 letter and also about the receipt of Exs. P12 P 13, reports of the chemical Examiner and and Serologist respectively. P.W. 17 continued further investigation. He examined P.Ws 1, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 on 14-6-1985. After completing the investigation P.W. 17 laid the charge-sheet on 24-7-1985 against all the four accused under
S. 302
read with
Sections 34
and
324
, I.P.C. to the Judicial II Class Magistrate, Kovilpatti.
6. When the accused were examined under
S. 313
, Cr.P.C. with regard to the incriminating circumstances appearing against them in the evidence, they totally denied the prosecution case. A1 in addition would state that the case put up against him is false. A2 would state that he was falsely implicated in view of the earlier case instituted against the deceased. A3 and A4 had nothing to say.
7. Learned trial Judge, after taking into consideration the oral and documentary evidence and for the reasons assigned in the judgment, came to the conclusion that the prosecution has proved the charge against A1 viz., the appellant herein under
sections 302
and
324
, I.P.C. and convicted him thereunder as stated in the opening paragraph of the judgment while acquitting A2 to A4 holding that the prosecution has not established the case against them beyond all reasonable doubt. Aggrieved by the same A1 has preferred this appeal.
8. Mr. T. Arulraj, learned counsel for the appellant took us through the recorded evidence and made various statements. According to learned counsel, the first information report under Ex. P1 is inadmissible in evidence as it is hit under
S. 161
, Cr.P.C. and further even if it admissible it is highly belated and hence no conviction can be imposed on the basis of the said case put forth in the first information report. He would further submit that the earlier report give in the case has been suppressed and that this case has been foisted against the appellant on account of the prolonged enmity. Learned counsel also vehemently argued that the witnesses who were examined in this case are all related and interested and that in view of the various answers elicited in cross-examination no reliance could be placed on their evidence. He would submit that the medical certificates issued in this case do not also support the case of the prosecution and particularly the ocular testimony of P.Ws 1 to 3. Learned counsel urged that there is absolutely no motive for the appellant to commit the occurrence of murder as even according to the prosecution, there was enmity between the deceased and A1 in respect of Kabadi game and that was in the year 1981. Learned counsel also submitted that the occurrence took place in a broad day light where there are number of shops and houses and the non-examination of independent witnesses also throws considerable doubt about the version of the prosecution and it is fatal. He would also submit that the learned trial Judge having disbelieved the major portion of the prosecution case, and acquitted A2 to A4, ought not to have accepted the evidence of P.Ws 1 to 3 and convicted the appellant. Learned counsel further submitted that the recovery of M.Os. 1 and 2 cannot be incriminating pieces of evidence to connect the appellant with the crime and the Court below erred in relying on the same for convicting the appellant.
9. Per contra, learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that in the instant case the delay in lodging the first information report has been explained by the prosecution through the evidence of P.Ws 14 and 12. According to him, it is the evidence of P.W. 14 that he entered the statement given by P.W. 5 in the General Diary as P.W. 5 is not and eye-witness of the occurrence and further P.W. 12, who took the first information report, was examined in order to explain the delay and it is for this court to consider from the said evidence whether the delay has been properly explained or not. No doubt, he fairly submitted that the prosecution ought to have produced the General Diary which was relied on by the prosecution very much to explain the delay as well as to get over the contention that the earlier report was suppressed wherein the earlier statement of P.W. 5 was recorded. He would further submit that merely because P.Ws 1 to 3 are interested and related their evidence cannot be rejected and it is for this Court to consider whether the evidence has to be taken into consideration only with due care and caution and if ultimately the Court comes to the conclusion that the evidence is not reliable, then only the accused are entitled to the benefit of doubt, and it is purely an appreciation of the evidence of P.Ws 1 to 3 According to him, the medical evidence so far as the attack on the deceased by A1 is consistent with the ocular testimony and it cannot be said that there is a material discrepancy which goes to be root of the case. He would further submit that the recovery of M.Os. 1 and 2 cannot be a clinching circumstance to connect the appellant with the crime. When once the evidence of P.Ws 1 to 3 is held to be acceptable, then, the same can be taken into consideration as a corroborative piece of evidence. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor also submits that on the mere fact that A2 to A4 were acquitted it cannot be said that A1 also ought to have been acquitted, and it is for the Court to consider as to how far the evidence of the witnesses can be believed so far as this appellant is concerned.
10. Now, the points for consideration in this appeal are :
1) Whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of this appellant beyond all reasonable doubt by acceptable evidence ?
2) Whether the inordinate delay in lodging the first information report has been explained and whether the earlier report has been suppressed as contended by the defence ?
11. POINTS 1 AND 2 : The prosecution mainly relied on the evidence of the eye-wintnesses, P.Ws 1 to 3 and the medical evidence adduced through P.Ws 9 and 10 for establishing the guilt of the appellant, who is A1. We have already set out the details of the case and the evidence adduced by the prosecution through P.Ws 1 to 3 and other witnesses. While narrating the prosecution case. Hence we do not propose to reiterate the same once again except such of those portions which are relevant and necessary for consideration of the various submissions made by learned counsel for the appellant as well as learn. Additional Public Prosecutor. Now let us consider the contention raised on behalf of the appellant with regard to the suppression of the earlier first information report and inordinate and unexplained delay in lodging the first information report in this case. According to prosecution, the occurrence took place at 9.15 a.m. P.Ws 1 to 3 are the eye-witnesses. P.W. 1 is admittedly related to the deceased as P.W. 5, the step-brother of the deceased was his brother-in-law and further he (P.W. 1) and the deceased were friends and they used to play Silambu game and both of them were closely moving.
12. The report in this case, Ex. P1 as well as the first information report, Ex. P14, were received by the learned Judicial Magistrate only at about 7.30 p.m. and there is a delay of 10 hours and 15 minutes. According to the prosecution, P.W. 4 came to the scene place immediately after the occurrence when P.Ws 1 to 3 informed P.W. 4. who requested him to go and report to P.W. 5, and P.W. 5, in turn, went to Pasuvandhanai police station at about 10.45 p.m. and reported the matter. But, according to P.W. 14, reported to him the fact that his brother Natarajan alias Subbiah was murdered when A1 cut him with an aruval and A2 stabbed him with Kuthu tharangu and that he got the information through P.W. 4 and he recorded the same in the General Diary and thereupon he proceeded to the scene place along with constables and recorded the statement Ex. P1 from P.W. 1, who was there P.Ws 1 to 3 had also stated that they gave the details of the incident to P.W. 4 and requested him to convey it to P.W. 5 P.W. 4 also informed P.W. 5 about the details of the occurrence. P.W. 5 also in his evidence stated that at about 10-15 a.m. P.W. 4 came to him and informed that his brother Natarajan was murdered by A1 to A4 and he in turn made the same report to Pasuvandhanai police station. It is to be noted that though it is stated that the same was entered in the General Diary, the General Diary was not even Produced in this case, exhibited and marked. Further, even P.W. 14 admitted that he did not show the General Diary to the Inspector. P.W. 16, and even in his statement he did not refer to anything about the entry made in the P.W. 16 P.W. 16 had categorically stated that and P.W. 14 ought to have recorded the complaint and registered the case. But, when he was further questioned whether he has taken any action against P.W. 14 for not taking the complaint and registering the case, he categorically admitted that he did not do so. It is the contention of the appellant that earliest first information report was suppressed and Ex. P1 came into existence long after the arrival of the Inspector and it was fabricated after due deliberation and consultation and on account of enmity the appellant was also impleaded as an accused. It is also to be noted that when an informant came and reported about the murder and also the names of the assailants and details of the occurrence, even though he is not an eye-witness, it is the duty of the Station House Officer to record the same and register a case. In the instant case it is stated on behalf of the prosecution that P.W. 5 was unable to give the full details of the incident, that he entered his statement in the General Diary and then proceeded to the scene place. Even P.W. 14 himself has stated that P.W. 5 complained that his brother was murdered when A1 cut him with an aruval and A2 stabbed him with Kuthu tharangu. If that be the case, it is the duty of P.W. 14 to record his statement and register case on the basis of the same and above all, even accepting his explanation, when he has chosen to record the in the General Diary, that is the very first document which came into existence where it is stated that the appellant was implicated, that should have been produced before Court. The failure to produce the said document even before the investigating officer is certainly fatal and there is every force in the contention put forward by the learned counsel for the defence that the appellant was implicated, that should have been produced before, Court. The failure to produce the said document even before the investigating officer is certainly fatal and there is every force in the contention put forward by the learned counsel for the defence that the entries made in the General Diary will go against the present version of the prosecution case and hence the earlier report also was suppressed. Even with regard to the recording of Ex. P1 from P.W. 1, there is no consistent version with regard to the time and also the circumstances under which it was recorded. According to P.W. 14, he wen to the scene place at about 11 a.m., saw P.W. 1 there and recorded a statement from him. There-upon he returned to the police station at about 11.45 a.m. and registered a case in Cr. No. 14 of 1985 whereas the first information report, Ex. P14, would show that the statement is said to have been recorded only from 11.45 a.m. to 12.15 p.m. Thereupon he returned to the police station. The police station is about 3 k.m. from the scene place. In the cross-examination of P.W. 14 it has been elicited that when he went to the scene place the Inspector of Police was already there. He has also fairly admitted in the cross-examination that in the investigation he did not say that since the details of the occurrence were not correctly known he went to the scene place. It is the evidence of P.W. 16 that at 12.40 p.m. he got the message from the police station about the case by V.H.S. from P.W. 14 and he reached the scene place at 1.30 p.m. When a question was put to P.W. 14 also as to whether P.W. 1 was brought from Tuticorin after he went there, he would state that he did not know.
13. Learned Counsel for the appellant drew our attention to the evidence of P.W. 1 and also the wound certificate issued to P.W. 1 as well as the Accident Register. P.W. 1 categorically admitted in his evidence that he went to the Pasuvandhanai police station even at 9-30 a.m. and he was there for about two hours.
Four of five persons were also there at that time. No signature was taken from him at the police station at that time. Another explanation put forward on behalf of the prosecution was that P.W. 1 was injured and hence he could not proceed to the police station and give a report. That has been falsified by the admission of P.W. 1 himself, who had categorically stated that he went to the police station by cycle and there is absolutely no explanation for his not reporting to the police station immediately. He also admitted that the Village Administrative Officer is also living in the village. Further, even though he was as in-patient in the hospital for nearly about twenty days, it cannot be said that he was not in a position to go to the police station immediately after the occurrence to give a report as it is seen from the Accident Register and the wound certificate that he of his own accord not being accompanied by any constable or anybody went to the hospital at recorded in Ex. P8 that the deceased accompanied by self for report as to certain injuries said to have been caused on 27-4-1985 and P.W. 1 was seen by him at 2.30 p.m. Learned counsel also drew our attention to the entries made in Ex. P9 wherein it is stated that he is alleged to have been assaulted with aruval at 9.15 a.m. On 27-4-1985 at Meenakshipuram by four known persons. According to learned counsel, since P.W. 1 has made such a statement it is only in order to support the said version Ex. P1 was later fabricated by implicating four persons and without attributing any overt act and three persons have been now acquitted. Further, in view of the finding of the trial court and in view of the evidence adduced in this case, even the trial court had not accepted the evidence of the prosecution with regard to the attack of P.W. 1 by four known persons. According to him, A3 pelted a stone on him and he sustained an injury. But, their is no injury on his chest due to pelting of stone and no stone was recovered. It is worthwhile to quote the evidence of P.W. 14 did not obtain any complaint from P.W. 1 though he was there. Only after the Inspector arrived at the scene place a statement was obtained from P.W. 1. This probabilises the version of the defence that Ex. P1 came into existence only long after the arrival of the Inspector. Learned counsel also submitted that even according to Ex. P1, P.W. 1 immediately after the occurrence ran away from the scene place towards south and he nowhere stated that subsequently he returned and also he had taken the broken pieces of the plank to his house. According to him, P.W. 1 could not have been the author of Ex. P1 but Ex. P1 could have been prepared much later after the arrival of the Inspector and the Sub-Inspector and after due consideration and deliberation on account of prior enmity between the deceased and the family of the accused. According to the defence, when the occurrence took place the deceased might have met with death much earlier to the alleged, in the morning, and nobody would have witnessed the occurrence and PW 1 would not have sustained injury at the time of the occurrence and in any event, having given an earlier report and suppressed the same they have now come forward with the present version by fabricating Ex. P1. In these circumstances, the delay in sending the first information report assumes much importance.
14. Further, on the face of admission of P.W. 1 himself that he was in the police station from 9.30 a.m. for about two hours, the entire version of the prosecution now put forward before this Court that P.W. 1 did not go there and that they sent information to P.W. 5 and the Sub-Inspector came to the scene place and obtained a statement Ex. P. 1 and on the basis of the same a case was registered are all contrary to truth. We have no hesitation in holding that no reliance could be placed with the present version of the prosecution. On the other hand, we find every force in the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the first information report could not have come into existence at about 11.45 a.m. as stated by the prosecution. That P.W. 1 was brought from the hospital and thereupon Ex. P1 could have been prepared is also probabilised by the admission of P.W. 2 who would state that immediately after the assault on P.W. 1 he was lying unconscious and he was taken in an unconscious state to Tuticorin hospital in a bus.
15. Now the prosecution also relied on the evidence of P.W. 12 to explain the delay in the despatch of the report to the Judicial II Class Magistrate, Kovilpatti. It is the evidence of P.W. 12 that at about 1 p.m. he got the first information report and he handed over the same to the Judicial II Class Magistrate at about 7.30 p.m. Thereupon he gave the copies of the same to the higher officials. When he was cross-examined he would state that it would take only 45 minutes to reach Kovilpatti from Pasuvandhanai by bus. He would state that he went by A.K.S.R. Bus on that day from Pasuvandhanai to Kovilpatti. When he was further questioned he fairly admitted that he did not purchase any ticket or there was no 'bus warrant' to support his version that he travelled in the said bus. He would further state that the said bus broke down and it was repaired only at 4.30 p.m. Thereupon he got another but at 6 O'clock. When he was asked whether he has stated all these things in his
Section 162
Cr.P.C., statement to the Inspector, P.W. 16, he fairly admitted that he did not say so. We have also perused his
Section 162
Cr.P.C., statement and there is absolutely no explanation whatsoever for the delay and the version now put forward by him for the first time in Court is nothing but an invention and without any basis. Further, it is also in evidence that on the day in question P.W. 14 admittedly had been to Ottapidaram and he was with P.W. 16 in connection with the bandobust for the celebration in the temple at Pasuvendhanai. This probabilises the version of the defence that P.M. 14 could have accompanied the Inspector and only after the arrival of the Inspector. Ex. P1 could have come into existence. From the version answers elicited in the evidence of witnesses and also the materials we find that the earliest versions put forward in this case has been suppressed and further the delay of nearly ten hours in lodging the first information report is inordinate and unexplained and this delay is certainly fatal in the circumstances of the case. In this connection, it is worthwhile to refer to the decisions of the Apex Court of the land.
In
Thulia Kali v. State of Tamil Nadu
,  it is held as follows :
"First information report in a criminal case is an extremely vital and valuable piece of evidence for the purpose of corroborating the oral evidence adduced at the trial. The importance of the above report can hardly be overestimated from the standpoint of the accused. The object of insisting upon prompt lodging of the report to the police in respect of commission of an offence is to obtain early information regarding the circumstances in which the crime was committed, the names of the actual culprits and the part played by them as well as the names of eye-witnesses present at the scene of occurrence. Delay in lodging the first information report quite often results in embellishment which is a creature of afterthought. On account of delay the report not only gets bereft of the advantage of spontaneity danger creeps in of the introduction of coloured version exaggerated account or concocted story as a result of deliberation and consultation. It is, therefore, essential that the delay in the lodging of the first information report should be satisfactorily explained".
In
Sevi v. State of Tamil Nadu
,  it is held as follows :
"Though he claimed that relevant entries had been made in the general diary at the Station the Sub-Inspector did not also produce the general diary in Court. The production of the general diary would have certainly dispelled suspicion. In the circumstances we think that there is great force in the submission of the learned counsel for the accused that the original F.I.R. has been suppressed and, in its place some other document has been substituted. If that is so, the entire prosecution case becomes suspect. All the eye-witnesses are partisan witnesses and not withstanding the fact that four of them were injured we are unable to accept their evidence in the peculiar circumstances of the case".
In Ramasamy v. State of Tamil Nadu (DB), 1982 LW Crl 63 : (1983 Cri LJ NOC 45 (Mad)) it is observed as follows :
"The FIR is a statement which can only be used to corroborate or contradict the version of the maker of it and if is not substantive evidence. If there is a doubt about the F.I.R. being fabricated or brought into existence to deliberation, the entire fabric of the prosecution case collapses. Fourteen accused have been implicated in this case who belong to the opposite group of the prosecution party. The court must, of course, make an attempt to separate grain from the chaff if it is possible. We are satisfied that, on the facts of this case and having regard to the interested evidence of the prosecution witnesses, it would be unsafe to convict the accused".
This view is supported by another Division Bench of this Court in Johny and Five others v. State, 1990 LW Crl 175, wherein it is held as follows :
"The first information report a document of considerable importance, is produced and proved in criminal trials not as a piece of substantive evidence, but with the avowed object of obtaining the early information of the alleged criminal activity and to have a record of the circumstances before there was time for them to be embellished or forgotten. A quick first information report, which reaches the Court of the Magistrate with promptitute, will be a towering circumstance which will go a long way to assure the veracity of the prosecution story if, there can be no time to create and deliberate a false case against the accused. It may be in some cases the delay in lodging the first information report may be inevitable, but such delay may have to be satisfactorily explained. Courts have held that long and unexplained delay not only in lodging the first information report but also in its receipt in the Court and suspicious circumstances to be taken into consideration while judging the bona fides of the prosecution story, as delay may bring in a coloured version of the whole incident. A delayed first information report, which gives rise to suspicion, will put the Court on guard to look for a possible and acceptable explanation for the delay. A delayed first information report in prosecutions where there are more accused than one will require careful scrutiny and more so when the possibility of false implication looms large".
Applying the ratio of the above decisions to the facts of this case, we have also no hesitation in holding that in the instant case Ex. P1 came into existence in a suspicious circumstance and there is every force in the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that by non-production of the alleged entry made in the general diary, the prosecution has Ex. P1 cannot be the first information report and it is not safe to rely upon Ex. P1 and in view of the inordinate and unexplained delay also, the contention put forward on behalf of the appellant that the version of the prosecution throws considerable doubt with regard to the participation of this appellant in this occurrence and that it is not safe to rely on the evidence of the eye-witnesses who are interested in the prosecution.
16. As regards the motive aspect is concerned, the prosecution relied on the earlier incident which is said to have taken place in the year 1981. Even according to the prosecution, in respect of a competition in the kabadi game A2 alone took part in the said game and he competed the deceased, and, on account of the same, a dispute arose and consequently A2 was stabbed by the deceased and it was only A2 who gave a complaint to P.W. 15, Sub-Inspector of Police, on 3-1-1981 at Eppothum Vendran police station and a case was registered in Cr. No. 2 of 1981 under section in 324
I.P.C
., which is evidenced by Ex. P15 and consequently it ended in conviction and the deceased was convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months. Though it is stated that on appeal he was acquitted, no documentary evidence whatsoever was produced before Court to substantiate the same. Even P.W. 15 is unable to say as to what happened after conviction. Whatsoever it may be, even according to the prosecution, after the incident the deceased left the village and he was employed as a taxi driver at Virudunagar and he used to attend the village two or three times in a month as his family was located at Meenakshipuram village. Further three is absolutely no dispute between A2 and the deceased after the said case. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever for this accused/appellant to attack the deceased and would go even to the extent of murdering him. Next the prosecution relies on the incident which is said to have taken place at about 8.15 a.m. when A1 went to the land of the father-in-law of the deceased where the deceased, P.W. 1 and P.W. 4 were attending to heaping up the hay-stalk and P.W. 6 was there and A1 called P.W. 6 to accompany him to the house of his master in order to secure the wages, and it is stated that it was at that time since A1 was having an aruval the deceased found fault with him and quarrelled and questioned him as to how he can bring aruval and A1 left murmuring. As rightly contended by learned counsel for the appellant we find that from these materials it cannot be said that A1 had adequate and sufficient motive to murder the deceased whatever it may be, since the alleged occurrence is said to have taken place in a broad day light and there are direct eye-witnesses to the occurrence, motive does not assume importance if the evidence of the eye-witnesses are otherwise trust-worthy and acceptable.
17. Now let us consider the evidence of the eye-witnesses, P.Ws. 1 to 3. P.W. 1 is admittedly related to the deceased as his elder sister Subbulakshmi is given in marriage to P.W. 5. P.W. 5 is the step-brother of the deceased viz., that P.W. 5 was born to another wife of the deceased's father. It is to be noted that though P.W. 1 was a witness to the occurrence and the occurrence is said to have taken place on 27-4-1985 he was examined only for the first time in respect of the occurrence only on 14-6-1985 by P.W. 17. There is no explanation for not examining him on a prior occasion and for the first time his
Section 161
Cr.P.C. statement was recorded, nearly about 1 1/2 months and the statement was sent only along with the charge-sheet. There is no explanation for not examining him at the earliest point of times as even though he was admitted as an in-patient in the Government Hospital by P.W. 10 on 27-4-1985 and he was discharged on 16-5-1985 itself and he sustained only simple injury and that too on the left arm and it is not the case that he was unconscious and he was unable to give any statement. The fact that his statement itself was recorded nearly after 1 1/2 months itself is sufficient to reject his evidence as no reliance could be placed on such a belated version during investigation and especially in respect of the important eye-witness to the occurrence who is the informant in this case. It is also in evidence that he is closely associated with the deceased, he is very much interested in the deceased, that both of them were always found together and they used to play Silambu. Learned counsel for the appellant drew the attention of this Court to the statement during inquest that at the time of occurrence he was actually collecting the hay-stalk, it is the case of the prosecution that the collecting of hay-stalk was only in the premises of the father-in-law of the deceased while the occurrence is said to have taken place on the road inside the village. P.W. 1 categorically admitted that he had stated to the Inspector when he was examined at the time of occurrence he was arranging the hay-stalk. If that be the case, he would not have been an eye-witness to the occurrence and he would not have sustained injury during the said incident. On the other hand, a suggestion was put to these witnesses that whether the deceased himself and others indulged in a quarrel in the village in the early morning and during the quarrel between them and the Devar community people the deceased would have met death and he also sustained injuries. We have already held that this version during his giving report at 11.45 a.m. is highly doubtful. His evidence with regard to the attack by A-3 on him by pelting a stone has been disbelieved and A3 has been acquitted on this ground. His conduct in the reporting the matter to the village Administrative Officer and as well as in the police station or to report others also throws considerable doubt in respect of his version now before Court. Further, learned counsel also drew our attention to his evidence that he and the deceased took coffee about a few minutes prior to the incident in the house of the father-in-law of the deceased. But, significantly P.W. 9, the Medical Officer attached to the Government Hospital, who conducted the autopsy did not find any liquid contents in the stomach and he had categorically stated that if any coffee or liquid has been taken it would have taken three hours for digestion. But, he found that the stomach was empty. This also was pointed out by learned counsel for the appellant that P.W. 1 would not have accompanied the deceased or the occurrence could not have taken place at the time and in the manner spoken to by this witness and no reliance could be placed. Further, learned counsel also relied on the evidence of P.W. 9 and the post-mortem certificate and submitted that when the stomack itself was empty the question of P.W. 1. and the deceased proceeding to answer calls of nature would not arise and as such his version that when he and the deceased were proceeding to answer calls of nature and at that time the deceased was attacked and when he intervened he was also attacked cannot be accepted. In any event, these aspects throw doubt about his version regarding the occurrence wherein he was an eye-witness. It is also to be noted that according to his evidence that he beat A1 with M.Os. 1 and 2 and A1 sustained bleeding injury on the back. If that be the case, certainly, the investigating officer should have given requisition to examine A1 by the Medical Officer, since A1 himself surrendered before Court within three days of the occurrence. There is absolutely nothing to show that he beat A1 and A1 sustained injuries and that M.Os. 1 and 2 were broken only in that circumstance. In any event, the failure on the part of the investigating officer to probe further and in the absence of any evidence with regard to the sustaining of injuries on the part of the person said to have been injured. This version cannot be accepted. The learned trial Judge is also not right in relying on the presence of blood-stains on M.Os. 1 and 2 as there is absolutely nothing to show that A1 sustained any bleeding injuries. Even otherwise, the mere fact that M.Os. 1 and 2 contained human blood, it is not sufficient to connect the same with the attack either on the deceased or on A1 unless in the absence of any detection of blood group which tallied with that of A1 or that of the deceased. Learned counsel also drew our our attention to the earlier version of this witness, P.W. 10, who is sustained injuries due to the cut with aruval by four known persons while his evidence Before Court is contra to the same. Thus, on a careful consideration of the above aspects, we have no hesitation in holding that the evidence P.W. 1 though injured is not reliable and no conviction can be given on the basis of the said evidence. The version of P.W. 1 now before court that after the occurrence he returned to the scene place and he was there till the police came is falsified by the earlier report wherein he had only stated that he ran towards south after the occurrence and there is absolutely nothing to show about his return. Similarly there is nothing about his taking the broken pieces of M.O. 1 and kept in his house. On the other hand, there is evidence to show that M.Os. 1 and 2 were available at the scene place when the Sub-Inspector came and as such on that score also his evidence is proved to be untrue.
18. Next we have to see the evidence of PW. 2. PW. 2 is a chance witness. He is a resident of Seekampatti. It is his evidence that on the day of occurrence he came to his elder brother's house in connection with a feast and while he was in the shop of PW 3 he happened to witness the occurrence. Admittedly there is a deformity in his leg and he cannot walk. He was actually sitting in the shop and witnessed the occurrence. It has been elicited in the cross-examination that it is not possible to witness the occurrence from the shop of PW 3. Only if one comes to the junction of the middle road can witness the occurrence. Since he is a lame man he cannot stand and he was actually sitting in the shop, he could not have witnessed the occurrence. Even he himself admits that he could not stand continuously for five minutes. According to his version in
S. 161
, Cr.P.C. statement nobody cut the deceased on the back, which is contrary to the case of the prosecution. He had categorically stated that the stone pelted by A3 may lying there and he pointed out to PW 14, Sub-Inspector and he took him and this has been falsified by the evidence of PW. 14. He did not see any such stone in the scene place. According to this witness, M.Os. 1 and 2 were blood-stained and they were taken from the scene place by PW 14 which is also contrary to the prosecution case. It is further admitted by him that PW 1 immediately after the occurrence ran towards south and the present version that PW 1 was at the scene place is contrary to his evidence. It was put to this witness that he never came to the village and he was only dependent upon the father-in-law of the deceased and it was only at his instance he was deposing falsely. Even the trial court pointed out while giving evidence he was sitting in a chair, he was aged 55 years and he was getting old age pension from the Government on the ground that he is an orphan. According to PW 3, this witness was sitting in his shop and he was conversing with him at the time of occurrence. PW 2 did not say that he was standing and witnessed the occurrence, but, on the other hand he would say that he was actually sitting in the shop at the time of occurrence. If that be the case, he could not have witnessed the occurrence. The various answers elicited in cross-examination of this witness clearly show that he could not have witnessed the occurrence and his presence also on that day in the village is highly doubtful.
19. Next comes the evidence of PW 3. PW 3 is aged about 52 years. Admittedly he is related to the deceased as his elder sister's daughter is given in marriage to the deceased. Further, while he was in witness box he was asked to identify the accused one by one. But, he was unable to do so though the witness box is about 25 feet from the place where the accused were standing. Learned counsel for the appellant rightly argued that if the witness was unable to identify the accused who was standing at a distance of 25 feet, this witness could not have witnessed the incident which is said to have taken place at 8 yards i.e., 24 feet away from his shop. We find every force in the contention of the learned counsel in this regard. When he is unable to see the accused who were at a distance of 25 feet, when he gave evidence in court, he could not have witnessed the incident and would not have seen this accused who was at a distance of 24 feet from the place where he was standing at the time of the alleged occurrence. Further, the shop of PW 3 was not shown in the rough sketch, Ex. P16 prepared by the investigating officer and it has been categorically admitted that it is not possible to witness the occurrence from his shop. He categorically admitted that he did not inform this incident to anybody who came immediately after the occurrence, including the father-in-law of the deceased. In view of the various answers elicited from the evidence of this witness, certainly, he could not have witnessed the occurrence. On the other hand, learned counsel for the appellant vehemently argued that according to the prosecution, the occurrence took place in the broad-day light and at the place of occurrence there were number of houses and shops. The investigating officer did not choose to examine any of the independent witnesses, particularly neighbours and there is absolutely no explanation for not examining them as witnesses in this case. Learned counsel for the appellant is perfectly justified in his submission that since those witnesses are not willing to depose falsely to support the version of the prosecution, they were not cited and examined and certainly in the absence of any explanation for not citing and examining their witnesses, an adverse inference can be drawn. It is not the case of the prosecution that though they have witnessed the occurrence they were not willing to depose. It is the duty of the prosecution to examine those witnesses and to cite them as witnesses and if they are not able to examine them in Court they should have given reasons for not examining them. In the instant case admittedly no attempt has been made to examine any of these independent witnesses and cited and examine them before the Court. Hence we are of the opinion that the non-examination of the independent witnesses is also fatal to the case of the prosecution besides the witnesses already examined, the evidence of PWs 1 to 3 is not reliable and acceptable.
20. Next we have to see the medical evidence. The medical evidence adduced through PW 9 who conducted the autopsy also did not support the case of the prosecution. PW 9 conducted the autopsy and noticed as many as four external injuries and issued the post-mortem certificate, Ex. P7. He would state that the deceased would have died as a result of the shock and hemorrhage due to injuries sustained by him before 24 hours and the injuries 2 to 4 are necessarily fatal. According to him, injury No. 1 could not have been caused by the Kuthu Tharangu and his evidence was accepted and A2 was acquitted on that ground. As regards injury No. 2, the evidence of PW 9 was that the said injury was fatal. After receipt of the injuries he could not have moved or walked and the death would have been instantaneous. According to the version of the prosecution, after receipt of the injuries he walked to a distance of 30 feet and thereafter he was attacked again by A1, who cut him twice on his back and the hip. This version has been falsified by the medical evidence and according to the medical evidence if injury No. 2 was caused first, injuries Nos. 3 and 4 are only post-mortem injuries. If that be the case, the present version that after receipt of injury No. 2 the deceased went to a distance and thereafter he was inflicted with injuries Nos. 3 and 4 only after receipt of the injuries Nos. 3 and 4 he died, cannot be accepted. The Medical Officer, PW 9 also probabilises the defence version that the deceased would have died about two hours prior to the time alleged by him. If that is accepted, the occurrence could have taken place at the early morning of that day. As already stated, the Medical Officer also ruled out the possibility of the deceased taking coffee prior to the occurrence since he had stated that if he had taken coffee prior to the incident. As regards the injury found on PW 1 also, the doctor opined that the injury found on PW 1 also, the doctor opined that the injury is a simple one and could have been caused about 2 to 3 hours prior to the alleged time for the injured and he himself admitted before the doctor. If already a case was registered and he was sent by the Sub-Inspector, certainly, he could have accompanied by a constable. This answer also clearly shows that till about 2.30 p.m. when he was present no case has been lodged and registered. Next the prosecution relied on the recovery of M.Os. 1 and 2 to connect this accused with the crime. We do not find any justification in the same. M.O. 1 is a plank. According to the prosecution, PW 16, has seized M.O. 1 from the house of A3 on the day of occurrence under Ex. P5. M.O. 2 was produced by PW 7, wife of PW 1 to PW 16 and both M.Os. 1 and 2 contained only human blood. It is to be noted that A3 from whose house M.O. 1 was seized was acquitted, and it is not the case of the prosecution that M.O. 1 was seized from the house of A1. Though he has stated that M.O. 2 was produced by PW 7, wife of PW1, we have got the evidence of the eye-witnesses that M.Os. 1 and 2 were lying at the scene place when the Sub-Inspector came. There is no consistent evidence with regard to the seizure of M.O. 2 on being produced by PW 7. In view of the answers elicited in cross-examination that M.Os. 1 and 2 which were lying in the scene place, the seizure by PW 16 during investigation from the house of A3 and from PW 7 there is considerable doubt and in any event, the fact that M.Os. 1 and 2 contained only human blood and the blood group could not be ascertained, and that they were seized during investigation from A3's house and being produced by PW 7, it cannot be said that the seizure of those M.Os. 1 and 2 which had not been used by A1 can be an incriminating circumstance against the accused to hold that he is liable for the offence of murdering the deceased. Thus, on a careful consideration of the entire materials, we are of the view that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of this accused in respect of both and he deserves to be acquitted and his conviction is not sustainable.
21. In the result, the appeal is allowed, the conviction and sentence are set aside and the appellant is acquitted. Bail bonds, if any, shall stand cancelled.
22. Appeal allowed.

                        PIUS C. KURIAKOSE, J.
                          -------------------------------
                       W.P.(C) No. 24041 OF 2006
                        -----------------------------------
                   Dated this the 31st day of July, 2007

                                 JUDGMENT
Exts.P1 and P2 orders under which the Motor Accident Claims

Tribunal refused to condone the delay of 280 days caused in the matter

of filing the application to set aside ex-parte award and dismissed the

application to set aside the ex-parte award are under challenge in this

Writ Petition under
Article 227.
Even though notice was served on the

3rd respondent, Insurance Company, there is no appearance for that

Company before this Court.
2. Heard Sri.G.Sreekumar, learned counsel for the petitioner and

Sri.M.B.Prajith, learned counsel for the 1st respondent. It is conceded

that the 1st respondent applicant before the MACT has already received

the award money. But under the award the Insurance Company is given

the right to recover the amounts from the petitioner who is found to be

the owner of the vehicle in question.          Sri.G.Sreekumar would submit

that the document of hire purchase was produced before the MACT and

that document will clearly show that the transaction between the

petitioner and the other parties was only one of hire purchase. A copy

of the hire purchase agreement was placed before me by

Sri.G.Sreekumar and I have gone through the same. Having gone
WPC No. 24041 of 2006
2
through the hire purchase agreement, I am of the view that the case of

the petitioner that the petitioner was not the real owner of the vehicle

merits consideration.
Under these circumstances, I set aside Exts.P1 and P2,

However, the same is being done only on condition that the petitioner

pays a sum of Rs.1,000/- to the High Court Legal Services Committee. I

would have been inclined to direct payment of cost to the Insurance

Company also but I am not doing so, since they have not chosen to

enter appearance in this court. Exts.P1 and P2 will stand set aside and

I.A. Nos.2950 and 2949 of 2004 in OP (MV) No.287 of 2000 will stand

allowed on condition that the petitioner pays a sum of Rs.1,000/- to the

High Court Legal Services Committee within three weeks of receiving

copy of this judgment. Once it is seen that the payment is made as

directed above, the MACT will repost MV(OP) for consideration and

dispose of the same on merits, i.e., in the light of the contentions raised

by the petitioner. The MACT will ensure that the fresh award to be

passed does not cause any prejudice to the 1st respondent in the MACT.

              Dated this the 14th        day of July, 2008.

                                JUDGMENT
The petitioner while working as Junior Superintendent in the

Health Services Department was promoted and posted as Senior

Superintendent in the        District Medical Office, with effect from

19.8.2006.    Ext.P2 contains the draft proposal for transfer in the

Health Services Department and it proposes the transfer of the

petitioner from Pathanamthitta to Allapuzha.         It was objected to by

the petitioner.      As per Ext.P3 order he has been transferred to

Thrissur. This is challenged by the petitioner inter alia on the ground

that his transfer to Thrissur is only to accommodate the 4th respondent

who is an office bearer of the NGO union and who was only recently

promoted as Senior Superintendent.
2.   A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the first

respondent. The 4th respondent has also filed a counter affidavit. The

petitioner has filed a reply affidavit. Learned counsel for the petitioner

alleges that there is violation of the norms in the matter of petitioner's

transfer to Thrissur.      The transfer is for accommodating the 4th

respondent, it is contended, and therefore it is vitiated by malafides.
Mere violation of the guidelines relating to transfer which are
WPC.18821 /2008                  2
not statutory in character will not result in an enforceable right as

such. I am not able to find anything material to accept the case of the

petitioner in this regard, but I do not finally express any opinion in

this regard. In my view, it is open to the petitioner    to move the

Government either seeking a variation of the transfer or a posting

nearer to his native district of Kollam.
In the result, the writ petition is disposed of permitting the

petitioner to move the Government against Ext.P3. If it is done within

three weeks from today, the third respondent shall consider and pass

orders in that regard, within a period of four weeks from the date of

receipt of a copy of this judgment. Since the petitioner has not been

relieved from Pathanamthitta on account of the order of status quo

passed on 23.6.2008, he shall be retained in Pathanamthitta till the

Government takes a decision in the manner aforementioned.          The

Government shall hear the petitioner and the 4th respondent before

taking a decision in that regard.

Bombay High Court
D.A. Kelshikar vs State Of Bombay on 19 September, 1958
Equivalent citations: (1959)61BOMLR1625, (1960)ILLJ66BOM, AIR 1960 BOMBAY 225, (1960) 2 LABLJ 66 61 BOM LR 1625, 61 BOM LR 1625
JUDGMENT
(1) The Plaintiff who was a  Sub-Inspector  of Police filed this suit inter alia for declaration that the order dated 5-4-1952 removing him from the police force of the State of Bombay is void and inoperative and that he continues to be a member of police force and for arrears of salry on that footing.
(2)  The main contention on which plaintiff prays for the aforesaid declation are contained in paragraphs 14(A) and 14(b) of the Plaint.  The Plaintiff relies upon the provisions of
Article 311(2)
of the Constitution of India.  The Plaintiff case is that he has not been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him s required under the Article and that the show cause notice tendered to him was not in conformity with the provisions of the
Articles     

 (3)
The plaintiff contends that the Defendent did not give to the Plaintiff any opportunity of showing cause against the accuracy of the facts founds by the District Superintendent of Police in a departmental inquiry against the plaintiff.  The second ground on which he plaintiff relies is that in January, 1952 when the show cause notice was tendered to the laintiff, in fact the plaintiff had already suffered the punishment inflicted upon him by the District Superintendent of Police and it was therfore not competent  for the Defendant  to revise the punishment already inflicted after lapse of two years.  The Plaintiff contends that the order of dismissal amounted to double punishment right of the Plaintiff under
Article 20(2)
of the Constitution of India.
(4)  There are several other gounds mentioned in para 14 of the Plaint for challenging the validity of the order of dismissal.  These  other grounds are however not pressed before me and it is unncessary therefore to summarise them here.
(5)  The facts leading to this suit are shortly as follows:  The Plaintiff joined the police force in the State of Baroda with the State of Bombay, the Plaintiff was absorbed in the police force of the State of Bombay  and on 1-8-1949 was confirmed as  Sub-Inspector of Police and was at material time attached to Karjan police station in Baroda District.  On 31-1-1950 the Plaintiff was found in the garden house of one Haribai Ramdas at village Atali..  At that house, what is prescribed as vet party (drinking party)  was then in progress.  On 2-2-1950, the District Superintendent of Police, Baroda district placed the plaintiff under suspension from 1-2-1950 on the ground that the plaintiff was involved in an offence under the prohibtion act and th3e matter was still under investigation and that the continuance of the plaintiff in office was likely to result in suppression of evidence.  Thereafter, the departmental enquiries proceeding were proceeded in connction with the said incident.  Statements of several persons were taken and ultimately on 21-3-1950, the District Superintendent of Police, Baroda, framed a charge against the plaintiff.  A copy of the charge framed was served on the plaintiff.  The charge framed as follows:-
"Serious misconduct in that you ..  ...   ..  ..  attended a drinking party in the garden house of Mr.Haribhai Ramdas at village Atali on 31-1-1950 in flagrant violation of the policy laid down by Government for rigid observance by all public servants vide Government Circular, Political and Serviced Department No.1581/34 dated 13-7-1948. Copies of the following documents are sent herewith in suport of the charge."
(6) The documents referred to are copies of a panchanama inquiry report, statements made by several persons, a letter addressed to the Collector by the Mamlatdar Baroda and the aforesaid circular dated  13-7-1948.
(7) It is admitted that the plaintiff received this charge sheet and the documents referred to in the charge-sheet. All these documents were also forwarded to the Dy.Superintendent of Police, Dhaboi for completing the departmental inquiry proceedings and submitting a report to the District Superintendent of Police for final orders.
(8) The Sub-Divisional Police Officer one Shri N.C.Mistri thereafter appears to have proceeded with the departmental inquiry.  It is relevant to point out that as regards the procedure in departmental inquiry, Rules have been framed. These Rules appear in Bombay Police Manual. It is admitted by the parties that the Rules provide for an elaborate procedure for departmental inquiry and inter alia provide for (1) giving  a defaulter all opportunities to be present at the hearing and to hear the evidence led in proof of the charge and cross examine the witness produced for the purpose, (2) for submitting the case for defence and for producing the evidence in defence and for giving complete hearing to the defaulter.
(9) It appears that the Sub-divisional Police Officer Shri.N.C.Mistri proceeded with the departmental enquiry in accordance with the aforesaid rules and provisions and in pursuance of those Rules made his report dated 25-4-1950.  In his report he summarised the evidence led before him and also gave his opinion as he was entitled to do. In his opinion the explanations given by the Plaintiff are acceptable and according to him the charge against the Plaintiff was not proved. The Sub-Divisional Police Officer appears to have forwarded his report in accordance with the Rules to the District Superintendent of Police who was a competent Officer to deal with the matter. By his deceision and order dated 6-5-1950, the District Superintendent of Police  one Shri.B.D.Shah after giving reasons therefor held that the charge against the Plaintiff was proved on evidence on reord beyond a shadow of any reasonable doubt. He therefore passed orders reducing the plaintiff from grade Rs.135/- to Rs.130/- for a period of one year from 01-05-1950. This decision and order served on the Plaintiff and he was also informed that he had a right to appeal against the order within two months from the date of receipt of order. The Plaintiff was given opportunity to appear before and was heard by Shri.B.C.Shah.
(10) The Plaintiff went in appeal against the aforesaid order on 25-7-1950.  The Dy.Inspector General of Police, Northern Range, dismissed the Plaintiff`s appeal on 13-9-1950.
(11) The Plaintiff thereafter accepted the order of punishment dated 06-05-1950 passed by District Superintendent of Police as binding and sufferred the punishment awarded to him. The punishment which was for one year was completed on 01-05-1951.
(12) By a show cause notice dated 11-01-1952 the defendant (the State of Bombay) referred to the Departmental Proceedings held against the Plaintiff by the District Superintendent of Police, Baroda and the  punishment inflicted upon the Plaintiff on 6-5-1950 as also to the appeal filed by the Plaintiff and the confirmation of the punishment in the appeal and further stated as follows :
' And whereas the Government of Bombay consider that the punishment inflicted upon you is inadequate you are hereby required to show cause within one month from the date of receipt of this notice why you should not be dismissed from the Police Force; if you fail to show cause within the aforesaid period, Government will inflict such punishment or pass such order as it deems fit."
This is the show cause notice on which  the main contentions of the plaintiff are based. It is at this stage necssary to note that in reply to the show cause notice, the plaintiff addressed a letter dated 19-2-1952 to the defendant through the Secretary, Home Department. By his letter the plaintiff dealt in detail with the charge levelled against him and the departmental proceedings which had taken place.  The plaintiff referred to his long past services and also that he had been the recipent of diverse awards from the Government of Baroda and of Bombay.  The plantiff prayed that the Government should take a lenient and human view of the whole situation and use its authority with mercy.  By its resolution datd 5-4-1952, the defendant after considering the representations made by the plaintiff by his letter dated 19-2-1952 passed orders dismissing the plaintiff from the police force.
(13) In May 1952 the plaintiff appears to have made a representation to the Government of Bombay in connection with his dismissal.  As the plaintiff did not succeed in his representation the plain tiff ultimately filed this suit on 16-7-1953.
(14) The plaintiff's counsel mainly relied on the provisions of
Art. 311(2)
of the Constitution of India in support of the plaintiff's contention that the order of dismissal was not valid.  Provision in Art 311(2) runs as under:
"311(2) No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him.
Provided.........................................."
(15) The provision in
Art. 311(2)
is a repetition of a similar provision in
S. 240(3)
of the Government of  India Act, 1935.  Both of these provision s have been construed in several dicisions of this court as well as the Supreme Court of Inida.  The provisions of
S. 240(3)
were the subject matter of decision of the Privy Council in what is popularly mentiuoned as Lal's case.
High Commr.  for
India and Pakjstan v. I. M. Lall
. Mr. mody places reliance on these decisions and submits that  

  "It was obligatory on the State to mention and include the grounds why they wanted to impose the punishment of dismissal in the notice dated 11-01-1952."
Mr. Mody elaborated his contention by stating that the notice should have specified the charge against the plaintiff and should have referred to the evidence in support of the charge and should have given all the gorunds with particulars as to why the Government (defendant) had tentatively  decided upon inflicting the punishment of  dismissal on the plantiff.  Mr. Mody contended that as all the aforesaiud matters had not been in detail specified in the notice dated 11-1-1952, the noitice wasw not real but illusory.  The notice did not give any reasonable or other opportunity to the plaintiff to make any contentions regardig the charge levelled against him.  Nor did it give any information about the evidence available in support of such a  charge/  Mr. Mody contended that the word "inadequate" in the notice was insufficient to convey to the plantiff any information regarding the gournds of enhancement of punishment.
(16) In connection with his aforesaid contentions, Mr. Mody relied upon the judgment of Chagla C. J. in the case of
State V. Gajanan Mahadev
,  .  Mr. Mody substantially relied upon the passage at page 178 of Bom. LR: (at p. 354 of AIR) where it is stated as follows:
"It is well settled law that it is not sufficient under this sub-section for the Government merely to inform the servant that it proposes to pass a particular punishment anmd to ask him to show causeagainst that punishment.  The opportunity which the State has to furnish has to be a reasonable opportunity, and the Courts have held that a resonable opportunity is only afforded to the servant when he can show cause not only  against the punisment but also against the ground on which the State proposes to punish him. Therefore, it is not sufficient that the State should call upon the servant to show ccuase against the quantum of punishment intended to be inflicted upon him; the State must also call upon the servant to show cause  against the decision arrived at by a departmental inquiry if that decision constitutes the ground on which the Government proposes to take action against the servant".
Mr. Mody therefore says that he was entitled to a show cause notice callng upon him to show cause  against the decision arrived at in the deprtmental inquiry and also that the decision in the departmental enquiry was a gound on which the dfendant has relied for the purpose of an enhancemnt of punishment.
(17) In furtherance of his contention Mr. Mody relied also upon the decision of the Privy Council in the case of 50 Bom. L. R. 649: (AIR 1948 PC 121).   He referred to the passage in the decision whereby their Lordships agreed with the view taken bythe majority of the Federal Court in that particular case.  Mr. Mody pointed out , from p. 655 of that report(Bom. LR): (at p. 126 of AIR) that the majority of the Federal Court held   

  " ................ It seems to us that the sectin requires not only notification of the action proposed but of the grounds on which the authority is proposing that the ation should be taken and that the person concerned must then be given a reasonable time to make his representations against the proposed action and the grounds on which it is proposed to be taken".
Mr. Mody says that no grounds are mentioned in he notice dated 11-1-1952 and the notice is accordingly not in conformity with the
Art. 311(2)
and the dismissal of the plantiff is invalid.
(18) It appears to me that the contention of Mr. Mody is ill founded.  As is pointed out in each of the aforesaid decisions it is for theCourt to find out from facts of each case as to whether reasonable opportunity has been afforded to the defaulter or the plaintiff within the meaning of the provisions of
Art. 311(2).
In the case of , it is pointed out by the learned Chief Justice as follows:
" It may also be said that it may not be necessary in every case to issue a notice in terms calling upon the servant to show cause not only against the quantum of punishment but also aginst the grounds on which the proposed acton  is based.  Even though, as in this case, the notice may be defective, if in fact the servant has been given the opportunity and has availed himself of the opportunity of showing cause against the grounds, then the mere fact that there is an irregularity about the notice may not lead to the Court holding that the Government Servant did not have the opportunity required under
section 240(3)
. But we think that there can be no doubt that the Court must be satisfied o a revirew of all the facts of a particular case that the statutory obligation cast upon the State has been porperly discharged by the Styate and the statutory obligation is to afford reasonable opportunity to the dismissed servant".
(19) In Lall"s case (AIR 1948 PC 121) their Lordships of the Privy Council in approving the judgment of the Federal Court accepted the following.
"In our judgment each case will have to turn on its own facts, but the real point of the subsection is in our judgment that the person who is to be dismissed or reduced must know that that punishment is proposed as the punisbhment for certain acts or omission on his part and must be told the grounds on which it is porposed to take such action and must be given a reaponable opportun ity of showing cuase why such punishment should not be imposed."
Their Lordships further added,  

  " If the civil servant has been through an nquiry under R. 55, it would not be reasonable thathe should ask for a repetition of that stage, if duly carried out, but that would not exhaust his staturoty right, and he would still be entitled to represent against the punishment porposed as the result of the findings of the enquiry".
(20) In the case of Khem Chand v. Union of  India , , Lall's case  was considered in detail.  The learnd Chief Justice of India at p. 505 (of SCJ): (at p. 306 of AIR) observed that:
" It is true that the provision (311(2) does not in terms, refer to different stages at which opportunituy is to be given to the officer concerned. All that it says is that the Government servant must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him. He must not only be given an opportunity but such opportunity must be a reasonable one..................  If the opportunity to show cause is to be a reasonable one it is clear that he should be informed about the charge or charges levelled against him and the evidence by which it is sought to be established, for it is only then that he will be able to put forward his defence.......... He should be allowed to show that the evidence against him is not worthy of credence or consideration .  All this appears to us to be implicit in the language used in the clause, but this does not exhaust his rights.  In addition to showing that he has not been gulity of any misconduct so as to ment any pun ishment, it is reasonable that he should also have an opportunity to contend that the charge proved against him do not necessarily require the particular punishment proposed to be meted out to him......."
At p. 507 (of SCJ): (at p.307 of AIR) the kearnbed Chief Justice after quoting the passage from
Lall
's case AIR 1948 PC 11) as quoted above held as follows:
"The above passage quite clearly explains that the point on which their Lordships of the Judgment Committee agreed with the majority of the Federal Court is that a further opporutnity I to be given to the Government servant after the charge have been established against him and a particular punishment is proposed ot be meted out to him .., but a close reading of the rest of that passage will indicate that in  heir  Lordship view the  substance of the protection of R. 55 is alos included in
S. 240(3)
and to that is superadded, by way of  futher protection, the necessity of givbing yet another opporutnity to the govenrment servant at the stage whbere the vcharges are proved against him and a particular punishment is tentatively proposed to be inflicted on hi.  Their Lordships referred to "statutory opportunity being reasonble afforbed at more than one stage", that is to say that the opportunity at more stages than one are comprised within the opportunity contemplated by the statute itself.  Of course if the government servant has been through the enquiry under R. 55, it was not be reasonable that he should ask for a repetition of that stage if duly carred out which implies that if no enquiry hasbeen held under R. 55 or any analogous rule applicable to the particular servant then it will bequite reasonable for him to ask for an enquiry."
(21)  It appears to me that what is
laid down by
the decisions in  and  is that in the event of a departmental enquiry having taken place according to the rules of proreasonable for any government servant to ask for a repetition of theat enquiry at the stage of enquiry as to nature and quantum of punishment. At that stage it is necessary by reason of
Art. 311(2)
to give him an opprotunity of showing cause against the punishment proposed to be taken in regard to him.
(22) I read the aforesaid decisions to mean that the departmental enquiry duly carried out satisfies the provisions of
Article 311(2)
so far as opportunity is to be afforded to a government servant in connection with the investigation of charge levelled against him.  After such an enquiry is duly carried out, it is necessarly under the provisions of
Art.  311(2)
to give a second opportunity rto the Govt.  servant (defaulter) to one again reagitate the matter as regards the conclusions already reached in the departmental enquiry.  In my view it is for that very reason that the learned Cheif Justice observed in the case of  that even though the notice may be defective, if the government servant has been given an opportunity and has availed himself of the opporutnity of showing cause against the grounds then the mere fact that there is an irregularity about the notice may not lead to the Court holding that the government servant did not have the opportunity required under
S. 240(3)
.
(23) In this connection I must refer to the recent decision in Appeal No. 69 of 1957 (Bom.). While dealing with the defective show cause notice
in that case
Chagla C. J. observed as follows:
"The last contention urged by Mr. Thakore is that the show cause notice which was issued by the commissioner of Police called upon him merely the show cause aginst the quantum of the sentence and not against the merits of the decision given.  It is perfectly true that it is now well settled law that a civil servant has a right to show cause both against the merits of the decision given.  It is perfectly true that it is now well settled law that a civil servent has a right to show  cause both against the sentence and the merits of the decision when the final show cause notice is issued against him and we would have taken a very serious view of the matter if the appealant had been deprived of the opportunity of showing cause against the findings arrived at both by the inquiry pofficer and the Commissioner of Police.  But unfortunately for Mr. Thakore, the appellant was not deprived of this opportunity because whatever might have een the form of the showe cause notice issued by the Commissioner of Police on 12-12-1955, in fact the appellant showed cause and showed cause very vigorously against the findings both of the inquiry officer and the commisioner of Police.  In face of this, we cannot possibly accept the contention of Mr. Thakore that there as a contravention of
Art.  311
of the Constitution."
It is relevant to point out that the contentions raised by the plaintiff in connection with the show cause notice dated 11-1-1052 appear to be merely technical.  In fact in spite of the alleged defective character of the notice the plaintiff by his letter dated 19-2-1952 raised all contentions as regards the merits of the charge levelled against him as also the qudxgion ov punishment.  The plaintiff not only had reasonable opportunity in the said connectionbut took opportunity and dealt with the matter on the footing that it was open tothe plaintiff to make contentions regarding all details of the charge and the evidece against him as also the quantum of punishment.  The plaintiff has not suffer  by the alleged defect in the notice.  The plaintiff has not made any contentions in the plaint regarding t he departmental enquiry and the same must be deemded to have been duly carried out.
(24) Having regard to my reading as aforesaid of the decisions of this Court, I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff had reasonable opportunity of showing cause in respect opf the charge levelledagainst him as also the quantum of punishment that was intended to be inflicted upon the plaintiff.  I am unable to accept the contention of the plaintiff that further grounds regarding the intended punishment of dismissal ought to have been mentiioned or included in the notice given by the defendant.  I do not accept the contentions as made in para 14 (a) of the plaint that the plaintiff has not been given any reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him as required by
Art. 311(2)
of the Constitution of India or that the notice is defective and not in conformity with
Art. 311(2) .
The plaintiff had complete opportunity to meet the charge levelled against him.  The plaintiff in fact led evidence in his possession before the proper authority in the said connection and failed to establish that he was not guity.  The plaintiff made all possible contentions regarding the quantum of punishment but failed to succeed.
(25) As regards the cobntents of the show cause notice dated 11-1-1952 I donot think that the same should have been more elaborate.  It is wothy of note that the plaintiff understood the meaning of this notice completely and took opporutnity to deal with the whole of the matter.  The quantum of punishment which was intended to be inflicted is mentioned in the notice.  Prior punishment already inflicted is referred to as inadequate.  The deaprtmental enquiry proceddings in which the plaintiff was punished are also mentioned in the notice.  The plaintiff was thereby  made aware that having regard to its Prohibition Policy the Government took a serious view of defaults of itts employees in connection with Prohibition Policy.  I am unabe to agree with the contention of Mr. Mody that the notice required to mention furthergrounds for intended en hanced punishment of dismissal.
(26) Mr. Mody contended that he was, having regard to delay in evision of punishment, entitled to a new tria and investigation of the charge against him.  He also contended that I should consider the true meaning and effect of the Government Circular regarding Prohibition Policy mentioned in the charge and hold that the finding in the departmental inquiry was incorrect.  I am of the view that the Court is not to reconsider on facts thje decision in the departmental enquiry.  The Court is not entilted to go into the facts to find out as to whether the finding isd correct or not.  I therefore do not think that it is necessary for me to go into these matters.  I cannot accept these contentions of Mr. Mody.
(27) The second contention of the plaintiff is that he having suffered the punishment the State was not entitled to revise or enhance the punishment inflicted upon him.  He contends that this was a case of "double punishment".  It is not denied that the State had a right to reconsider the whole of the charge levelled against the plaintiff, and to inflict punishment in revision as it deemed necessary.  The plaintiff has not raised any contention that the State had nob jurisdiction to deal with the matter.  Mr. Mody did not make any argument in support of such contention.  The plaintiff has based all his argument in support of this contention on
Art. 20(2)
of the Constitution of India.  That Article runs as follows:
"No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once".
This Artlcle has been construed on several occations.  In the case of S. A .
Venkataraman v. Union of India
, , following
Magbool Hussain v. State of Bombay
,  it has been held that:
" The language of
Art. 20
and the words actually used in
Art. 20(2)
afford a clear indication that the proceedings in connection with the prosectuion and punishment of a person must be in the nature of a criminal proceeding, before a cxurt of Law or Judicial Tribunal, and not before a Tribunal which entertains a departmental or an administrative inquiry even though set up by a Statute, butn  which is not required by law to try the matter judicially and on legal evidencve."
In fact Mr. Mody is unable to carry his arguments further having regard to this judgmnt of the supreme Court which was pointed out by Mr . Dubash .  There was no question of a criminal prosectuion in this case and/or double punishment and I cannot therefore accept the contention raisedd on behalf of the plaintiff.
(28) In  this connection Mr. Dubash also relied upon the judgment of Gajendragadkar J.  in this Court in Spl. C. A. No. 180 of 1954 where it was held as follows:
" It is then contended that this amounts to a double punishment.  In our opinion this argument is wholly fallacious.  There are not two punishments with which the petitioner is conerced.  The petitioner received a minor punishment at the hadns of the District superintendent of Poli ce and  in the exercise of his revisional jurisdiction the Inspector Gnmeral of Police has enhanced that punishment.  It is impossible to accede to the argument that enhancemernt of punishment made in exercise of revisional jurisdiction amounts to a second punishment and that in such a case the party is exposed to the risk of double punishment.  Therefore we must reject the argument that in the present case the petitioner has been subject to the risk of double punishment."
There is no substance in the contention of the plaintiff that he has suffered double punishment.
(29) Issues Nos. 4 to 9 were not pressed seriously on behalf of the plaintiff.
(30) My answers to the issues accordingly are:
1. Negative.
2. Negative.
3. Negative.
4. Negative.
5. Negative.
6. Negative.
7. Negative.
8. Negative.
9. Negative.
10. Negative.
11.Negative.
(31) After I had delivered iun cout this judgment, in another matter I have been referred to the deicision in
Atindra Nath v. G. F. Gilot
, .  I have only to record that
in that case
also it has been held (as I have done in this case) that it is unnecessarly to give a second hearing to a defaulter in case where departmental enquiries have been duly completed.
(32) In the result the suit is dismissed with costs.
(33) Suit dismissed.

         Dated this the 16th day of November, 2007

                        J U D G M E N T
Although Exts. P4 and P5 appeals filed by the petitioner in

relation to the assessment years 1996-97 and 1997-98 have

been heard on 19/10/2007, orders have not been passed till

date. However, in the meantime, Ext.P7 notice has been issued

under the
Revenue Recovery Act
and hence this writ petition.
2.   Now that appeals itself have been heard and orders

have been reserved by the 2nd respondent, I deem it appropriate

that further proceedings pursuant to Ext.P7 should be deferred

until orders are pronounced in the appeals.
3.   Accordingly, I direct that the 2nd respondent shall pass

orders on Exts. P4 and P5 appeals, as expeditiously as possible,

at any rate within four weeks of receipt of a copy of this

judgment.
4.   In the meantime, further proceedings pursuant to
WPC 33911/07

Ext.P7 will stand deferred.
Petitioner shall produce copy of this judgment before the 2nd

respondent for compliance.
Writ petition is disposed of as above.

in autorickshaws and other matters including a copy of only             that portion of the relevant document which 

details the mechanism of use of the panic          button  by   a   passenger;,  communication   of   emergency  to   the 

Central Command Centre  and the name of and the details of the action on the part of the agency that will 

take     action as a consequence; detailed specifications of GPS/GPRS and other                         related/attached 

equipment such as display unit, printer, paper roll etc; a sample of              the GPS/GPRS device together with 

all related/attached equipment such as printer,              paper roll etc;  detailed break­up under various heads

Madras High Court
In Re: Vanu Ramachandriah vs Unknown on 4 May, 1927
Equivalent citations: (1927)53MLJ723
ORDER
 

Wallace, J.
1. The petitioner has been convicted of an offence under
Section 161
of the Indian Penal Code read with
Section 116
. His contention is that on the facts found the offence has not been established.
2. The facts found are that on 15th November, 1925, he, a Municipal Councillor of the Wallajapet Municipal Council, did, in a letter written to the complainant, who was the manager of the office of the same Municipality, say to him, "The matter regarding the lock-up shed, Mr. Manicka Seshayya is keen about it. Will you 'just try that job for him? I now here take my full privelege to you to say that he makes an offer of rupees two hundred to you in case he gets it. I shall stand surety for it if you can interfere in the matter and have it settled. If you can assure me, he is prepared to deposit the amount". The giving of a contract for this lock-up shed lay with the Chairman and the Councillors. I have no doubt what this letter means. The petitioner informs the manager that if he uses his influence with the Chairman and Councillors to secure the contract for Manicka Seshayya, he will get Rs. 200 from Manicka Seshayya or, if not from him, then from himself, the petitioner. That is, in effect he says,, "I, at any rate, will see that you get Rs. 200 if you get the contract for Manicka Seshayya". That is equivalent to an offer of Rs. 200 if he gets the contract for him. I am not able to support the contention that this is a merely passing on of an offer by Manicka Seshayya himself. It is clearly an undertaking by the petitioner himself that he will, if necessary, pay this Rs. 200 when the contract is obtained. I am clear therefore that this is an offer by the petitioner of an illegal gratification to the complainant in his capacity as manager of the Municipal Office, to use the influence he possesses in such capacity over the Chairman and Councillors in order to procure this Municipal contract for Manicka Seshayya.
3. It is next contended that even so petitioner's conduct does not amount to an abetment of an offence under
Section 161
, first because even if complainant had accepted the bribe he would not have committed an offence under that section and therefore there cannot be any abetment of such an offence, secondly that petitioner's conduct did not amount to a real offer and thirdly that at the most his conduct amounted to a mere abetment of an attempt or an instigation of an abetment. He further raised the question whether the complainant is a public servant. That point however was never raised in the Courts below where it was not disputed that he was a public servant. Whether he is or is not is a question of fact and I am not prepared to let it be raised here for the first time and I take it that the complainant is a public servant.
4. The essence of the first contention is that the complainant was not asked to do an official act since officially he has nothing to do with such a contract, but
Section 161
is not confined to cases in which the gratification is taken for doing an official act. The wording of the section is clumsy, but it does not appear to me to be so restricted. From that wording and omitting words which are. superflous for this argument it is an offence if a public servant accepts any gratification other than legal remuneration as a motive or reward for rendering or attempting to render any service to any one with any public servant as such. Now here on the facts if the complainant, the manager of the Municipal Office and a public servant, had accepted the Rs. 200 as a reward for using his influence with the Chairman and the Councillors as such to get a contract for Manicka Seshayya, which contract was in the gift of the Chairman and Councillors as such, I have no doubt that he would be guilty under
Section 161
, whether or not the act which he did was an official act. Incidentally I can see no reason for supposing that what the Chairman and Councillors as a body do or can do officially they do not do as a public servant.
5. As to the second contention, it is not necessary that the gratification need actually be produced. I have already held that petitioner was obviously making a firm offer to pay the complainant Rs. 200 if Manicka Seshayya got the contract through his good services. As to the third contention, the petitioner offered the gratification and although the complainant did not accept it, petitioner would still be guilty under
Section 116
. See illustration (a) to that section. That illustration no doubt deals with an offer for a bribe to a public servant for showing favour in the exercise of his official functions. But the principle of the illustration obviously applies as much to the other purposes set out in
Section 161
as to doing or forbearing to do any official act.
6. It is pleaded that the charge framed was obscure, but so far from that being the case, it seems to me to set out clearly the exact conduct contemplated in the latter part of
Section 161
so as to bring the abetment by the petitioner under
Section 116
. The charge runs that 'You offered illegal gratification of Rs. 200 to Rajam Aiyar, manager, Municipal Office, Wallajapet, as a motive or reward for rendering a service to Manicka Seshayya with the Chairman and Councillors, to wit, to procure for Manicka Seshayya the contract of a lock-up shed". It has been quite clearly framed with an eye to that part of
Section 161
which is applicable to the case.
7. Petitioner calls in aid a ruling of a Bench of the Bombay High Court reported in
Emperor v. Amir-ud-din
(1922) 24 Bom. LR 534, but there, as will be seen, there was no offer by the accused himself. He merely stated that some one else was willing to bribe. In the present case the petitioner himself made an offer in what he guaranteed the money if the favour was granted.
The case in Upendranath Chowdhury v. The King-Emperor (1916) 21 CWN 552 is distinguishable on the ground that the money taken there was not for rendering service with any pubic servant as such. The case in Venkiah, In re (1924) 47 MLJ 662 has been relied upon. But there the facts again do not show that the kurnam took the money for rendering a service with any public servant as such and therefore the conviction could not stand unless it was proved that he took it for doing an official act which was held not proved on the facts. None of these cases therefore are of any assistance to the petitioner. I therefore do not see that any error of law has been committed by the Lower Courts and the conviction is proper and must stand.
8. I am asked to reduce the sentence, but having regard to the necessity for severely punishing attempts to foul the purity of official administration, I am not prepared to interfere. I therefore dismiss this petition.

Madras High Court
The United India Life Assurance Co. Ltd. ... vs P.V. Sarma on 23 November, 1928
Equivalent citations: (1929)56MLJ79
JUDGMENT
 

 Kumaraswami Sastri, J.
1. This is an application for review of taxation. The original application was by a notice of motion under
Section 45
of the Specific Relief Act for directing the United India Life Assurance Company, Limited, to do certain things. The application is also entitled "In the matter of the United India Life Assurance Company, Limited" as required by the rules. But this is not an application under any of the sections of the
Indian Companies Act
. It is purely an application under
Section 45
of the Specific Relief Act. The learned Judge dismissed the application with "costs," but the order as drawn up is "taxed costs."
2. The contention raised by the applicant is that the order is wrongly drawn up, inasmuch as the learned Judge did not allow "taxed costs." The other contention is that, as the party did not appear by attorney but only by counsel, he is not entitled to bring in a bill for each item of work done and that all that the Court could do, even if the order as drawn up is right, is to award such costs as are allowable to an advocate appearing in a notice of motion. I think Rule 20 of Order 6 of the Fees Rules only refers to petitions or proceedings under the
Indian Companies Act
, Probate and Administration matters, petitions under the
Guardian and Wards Act
, Income-tax Cases, Habeas Corpus applications, claims to attached properties, application under the Trustees Act, Administrator-General's Act, arbitrations, and similar matters. I do not think that there is any provision under the rules by which an application under
Section 45
of the Specific Relief Act will entitle an Advocate not appearing by Attorney to bring in an itemised bill as has been done in the present case charging for attendance and various other matters as if the Advocate himself was both attorney and advocate. The petitioner's Advocate states that he is willing that the bill may be taxed and does not want an amendment of the order, but his contention is that it should be taxed on the footing of a notice of motion conducted by an Advocate without an attorney and that he is prepared to pay whatever fees the taxing officer will allow on such taxation. I think his contention is right. If the matter does not fall under Order 6, Rule 20 it is clear that the bill such as is brought in by the Advocate for the counter-petitioner cannot stand.
3. I allow the application and direct the taxing officer to tax the bill on the footing that the order is for taxed costs on a notice of motion presented and conducted by an advocate without an attorney.

3.   28/09/2010
This reference under
section 256(2)
of the
                  Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as `the
                  Act') arises from the judgment and order dated 31st May
                  1990 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in
                  R.A. No.50(Patna)/1989, arising out of Income Tax
                  Appeal No. 267 (Pat)/1987, relating to the Assessment
                  Year 1983-84.
The     respondent-assessee,      a   Development
                  Officer in the Life Insurance Corporation of India
                  (hereinafter referred to as `the Corporation') had, in the
                  previous year relevant to the Assessment Year 1983-84,
                  received incentive bonus of Rs.80,622.20 paise from the
                  Corporation. Out of the said amount of incentive bonus,
                  the assessee claimed deduction of 40% as expenses.
2
According to the assessee, the incentive bonus was an
"income from profession" and was not a part of the
"salary". The Assessing Officer did not accept the claim
of the assessee. Order of the Assessing Officer was set
aside by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of
Income tax. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner held
that the amount of incentive bonus was an "income from
profession". The assessee was, therefore, in consonance
with the Board's circular no. 1774 dated 29th September
1987 entitled to a deduction of 40% claimed by him. The
challenge to the appellate order before the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal failed.    The tribunal held that the
incentive bonus cannot be treated as a part of salary and
that it is a professional income. The tribunal directed the
Assessing Officer to allow 40% deduction from the
incentive bonus.
The present Reference is made at the instance
of the Revenue for resolution of the following questions
of law:-
"1. Whether on the facts             and in the
     circumstances of the case,       the Income-tax
     Appellate Tribunal was justified in holding
     that the incentive        bonus earned by an
     assessee was not covered by salary and is in
     nature of commission earned               by the
     Insurance Agent against which expenses to
     the extent of 40% were allowable in view of
     Board's Circular        no.1774 dated 20.9.1987
     communicated vide F.no.200/172/84/IT (A.I.)
3
dated 14.10.1987?
2.   Whether on         the facts   and in the
     circumstances of the case the assessee is
     entitle to claim 40% as expenses from
     incentive bonus?"
Learned Advocate Mrs Archana Sinha has
appeared for the department. She has submitted that the
above-referred questions are no more res integra. This
court (Coram: Chandramauli Kr. Prasad, J, as he then
was, and Jayanandan Singh, J.) has decided the issue in
the matter of the Commissioner of Income Tax, Bihar,
Patna Vs. Ramjee Prasad ( Tax Case No.13 of 1991).
By the judgment and order dated 7th February 2008, this
court has held as under:-
"The incentive bonus given to the assessee was
     not granted by the Life Insurance Corporation
     of India for the purposes as set out in
Section
     10(14)
of the Act.        Once it is held so the
     assessee cannot claim deduction at the rate of
     40% taking shelter behind
Section 10(14)
of
     the Act.       We are of the opinion that no
     provision other than
Section 10(14)
of the Act
     exists   for       allowing   deduction   towards
     expenditure of the nature claimed by the
     assessee. Incentive bonus or part thereof is not
     reimbursement of expenditure by the employer
     to qualify for deduction under
Section 10(14)
of the Act. We are of the opinion that
4
expenditure under
Section 10(14)
of the Act
     can be allowed only when it is granted to meet
     expenses       wholly     and     exclusively      in
     performance of the duty and that too to the
     extent such expenses are actually incurred for
     that purpose."
Learned Advocate Mr Ajay Kumar Rastogi
has appeared for the assessee. At the outset, he has
challenged the maintainability of the present Reference.
He has submitted that the Government of India has taken
a conscious decision under its communication dated 27th
March 2000 not to file appeal before the High Court
unless the tax effect exceeds Rs. 2 lakhs. The said
instruction   has   since    been   modified.   Under    the
communication dated 24th October 2005, the above-
referred monetary limit of Rs. 2 lakhs has been raised to
Rs. 4 lakhs. He has submitted that the aforesaid
instruction would apply not only to the appeals to be filed
thereafter but also to the appeals/references pending on
the date. He has submitted that as in the present case the
tax effect is less than the aforesaid monetary limit, the
case requires to be dismissed.
In support, he has relied
upon the judgment of the Bombay High Court in the
matter of
Commissioner of Income-Tax Vs. Pithwa
Engg. Works
(276 ITR 519).
In the above-referred matter, the Bombay
High Court relied upon the instruction dated 27th March
2000 in an Income Tax Reference filed in the year 1988.
The Bombay High Court held,
5
"The above instructions dated March 27,
      2000 reflect the policy decision taken by the
      Board not to raise questions of law where the
      tax effect is less than the amount prescribed in
      the above circular with a view to reduce
      litigations before the High Courts and the
      Supreme Court. The said circular is binding
      on the Revenue though learned counsel tried
      to contend that the said circular is not
      applicable to the old referred cases. However,
      he could not take his submission to a logical
      end.
One fails to understand how the Revenue
      can contend that so far as new cases are
      concerned, the circular issued by the Board is
      binding on them and in compliance with the
      said instructions, they do not file references if
      the tax effect is less than Rs. 2 lakhs. But the
      same approach is not adopted with respect to
      the old referred cases even if the tax effect is
      less than Rs. 2 lakhs. In our view, there is no
      logic behind this approach."
We are unable to agree with the opinion of
the Bombay High Court. The Government of India has
decided that appeals would be filed only in cases where
the tax effect exceeded the revised monetary limit given
thereunder, that necessarily means that those instructions
would apply to the appeals/references which were yet to
be filed or, in other words, the appeals/references filed
6
after 27th March 2000. In our opinion, the High Court
cannot    refuse       to   consider   and   decide   the
appeals/references which are already filed and pending
before the High Court for decision taking shelter under
the above-referred instruction dated 27th March 2000 or
any other instruction of similar nature.
Mr Rastogi has next submitted that the above-
referred judgment in the matter of Ramjee Prasad is per
incuriam the decision of the Gujarat High Court in the
matter of
Commissioner of Income-Tax Vs. Kiranbhai
H. Shelat & Anr.
(235 ITR 635). He has submitted that
the Gujarat High Court has in no uncertain terms held
that the Development Officers of the Corporation are
entitled to deduct actual expenses incurred by them to the
maximum of 30% from the amount of the incentive
bonus received by them from the Corporation.
In the matter of Ramjee Prasad, identical
question of law was referred to this Court. This Court
followed the judgments of the Full Bench of the
Karnataka High Court in the matter of
Commissioner of
Income-Tax Vs. M.D. Patil
[1998 (220) ITR 71] and of
the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the cases of
Commissioner of Income-Tax Vs. A.K. Ghosh
[(
2003)
263 ITR 536] and of Commissioner of Income-Tax Vs.
Gurudeo Singh Jaggi
[(2004) 267 ITR 763]. The
aforesaid High Courts have taken a consistent view that
the amount of incentive bonus received by the
Development Officers of the Corporation is not referable
to and is not exempt under
Section 10(14)
of the Act, but
7
is a `salary' within the meaning of
Section 17(1)(iv)
of
the Act. The only deduction admissible will be the
standard deduction available under
Section 16
of the Act.
The appeal preferred against the above-referred judgment
of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh was not entertained
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.
The Gujarat High Court also has the same
view insofar as
Section 10(14)
of the Act is concerned. It
has been held that the incentive bonus is a salary within
the meaning of
Section 17(1)(iv)
of the Act. It further
held, "the Development Officer can still demonstrate
that he was required to incur the expenditure as a
part of his duty to enable himself to realize the
proceeds of the Incentive bonus. Thus, for working
out the amount of profit in addition to salary, there
would be deduction from the gross Incentive bonus,
expenses properly incurred in realizing it. This
deduction would be warranted to reach the profit
element cannot be denied to the assessee-employee on
the ground that the statutory deductions are already
provided in
Section 16
."
In view of the aforesaid discussion, it was
decided that the Development Officer of the Corporation
was entitled to deduction of the actual expenses incurred
by him up to a maximum limit of 30% of the amount and
that the net amount after such deduction is the salary
income.
We may first note that the judgment of the
Gujarat High Court is not a binding precedent. The
8
judgment in the matter of Ramjee Prasad (supra) cannot
be said to be per incuriam as submitted by Mr Rastogi.
Further the reliance placed on the Board's circular no.
1774 dated 29th September 1987 was also uncalled for.
The said circular no. 1774 is placed before us. It is
apparent that it contains a clarification of its earlier
circular no. 1546 dated 6th January 1984. It only clarifies
that the earlier instruction was issued in respect of the
commission earned by the insurance agents and that it
did not apply to the Development Officers of the
Corporation, who are full time employees of the
Corporation and are in receipt of regular salary. It has
been reiterated that "the payment received by the
Development Officers as incentive bonus or bonus
commission (or by any other name) is for the work
done for the employer. It is in lieu of or in addition to
salary and forms part of salary by virtue of
Section
17(1)(iv)
of the Act." In our opinion, the tribunal and the
appellate authority below both were wrong in holding
that the incentive bonus received by the Development
Officer is an "income from profession" and that the
assessee was entitled to 40% deduction as expenses.
In view of the above binding precedent, we
answer Question nos. 1 & 2 in favour of the Revenue and
against the assessee. We hold that the incentive bonus
earned by the assessee was the salary within the meaning
of
Section 17(1)(iv)
of the Act. The assessee was,
therefore, not entitled to 40% deduction as expenses
from the amount of incentive bonus as claimed by him.
9
In the present case, we are not called upon to
        consider whether or not the assessee was entitled to
        deduction of actual amount of expenses incurred by him
        to a maximum of 30% as the assessee has not claimed
        any deduction as expenses actually incurred by him to
        earn incentive bonus.
The reference is answered in the above terms.
        The parties will bear their own cost.

Income Tax Appellate Tribunal - Mumbai
Asstt. Cit, Range 10(1) vs Citicorp Finance (India Ltd.) on 21 November, 2006
Equivalent citations: [2007]108ITD457(MUM), [2008]300ITR398(MUM), (2007)111TTJ(MUM)82
ORDER
D.K. Srivastava, Accountant Member
1. The department has filed the present appeal on the following grounds:
1. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) has erred in directing to allow deduction of Rs. 1,94,96,945 on account of the provisions for accrued expenses which was correctly disallowed by the assessing officer.
2. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case and in law, the learned Commissioner (Appeals) has erred in directing to allow exemption under Section 10(33) in respect of whole dividend income of Rs, 4,85,24,362 instead of the net income rightly determined by the assessing officer at Rs. 1, 17,21,951
2. Briefly stated, the facts of the case are that the assessee- company was engaged in the business of providing financial services like commercial vehicle financing, equipment finance, advances against financial assets and inter-corporate loans and deposits. During the course of the assessment proceedings, the assessing officer noticed that the assessee had earned dividend of Rs. 4,85,24,362 which was exempt from tax. Taking note of
Section 14A
of the Income Tax Act, he called upon the assessee to furnish the details of expenditure incurred in earning the aforesaid dividend and also to explain as to why expenditure on pro rata basis should not be apportioned to the earning of the aforesaid dividend. In reply, the assessee submitted before the assessing officer that it had not incurred any expenditure in earning the aforesaid dividend and hence the pro rata basis could not be applied to allocate the expenditure for earning the said dividend. In the absence of details, the assessing officer applied pro rata basis for allocating the total expenditure of Rs. 90,64,63,336 between exempt income (i.e., dividend) and non-exempt income in the ratio of their receipts (total receipts being 119,48,19,592 including dividend receipts of Rs. 4,85,24,362). In this manner, he quantified the expenditure at Rs. 3,68,02,411 being 4.06 per cent of total expenditure as having been incurred in relation to earning the(dividend and therefore disallowed the same while computing non-exempt income. On appeal, the learned Commissioner (Appeals), by his order dated 16-6-2003, directed the assessing officer to allow deduction on the gross amount of dividend without allocating any expenditure. department is aggrieved by the aforesaid order and is now in appeal before this Tribunal.
3. In support of appeal, the learned departmental Representative relied upon the grounds of appeal, the assessment order and the provisions of
Section 14A
and submitted that the impugned disallowance was in conformity with the aforesaid provisions.
4. In reply, the learned Counsel for the assessee submitted that gross dividend amounting to Rs. 4,85,24,362 was received from nine companies which was exempt from tax. According to him, dividend income was reflected in the accounts under the head "Permanent investments". It was also submitted that all deployment of funds in permanent investments were made out of capital infusion into the assessee- company from Citicorp Overseas Investment Corporation and that all outside borrowings were made for meeting the requirements of working capital of the assessee-company and not for making the permanent investments. It was vehemently contended that since all the investments on which dividend was earned were entirely made out of own funds and, in this view of the matter, no interest expenditure incurred by the assessee was allocable to the earning of dividend income.
5. He invited our attention to the provisions of
Section 14A
and submitted that rule of proportionality of expenditure was not applicable for making the disallowance under
Section 14A
.
6. He further submitted that the issue under consideration had since been decided by this Tribunal in favour of the assessee by order dated 7-10-2005 in the department's appeal in the assessee's own case for assessment year 1998-99. In this connection, he invited our attention to para II of the said order, which reads as under:
We have heard both the parties. The Delhi Tribunal, in the case of Maruti Udyog Ltd., cited supra, has held that no disallowance could be made under
Section 14A
where the assessee has interest-free funds far and excess of amounts invested in shares of other companies. The assessee-company was having capital far and excess of the investment made on which the dividend income was received. Moreover, it has been held by the various courts that proportionate disallowance of expenses is not permissible. The findings of the learned Commissioner (Appeals) are upheld and the third ground is dismissed.
7. He also invited our attention to another order dated 19-1-2006 passed by this Tribunal in the department's appeal in the assessee's case for assessment year 1999-2000 in which the earlier order of the Tribunal for assessment year 1998-99 has been followed.
8. We have heard both the parties and considered their submissions including the judicial authorities cited by them. Short issue in the matter before us is whether the provisions of
Section 14A
empower the assessing officer to make proportionate allocation in respect of the expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income and consequentially take the same into account for computing the exempt income and, if so, whether the mechanism for computing allocation of such expenditure as provided in Sub-section (2)/(3) of
Section 14A
(inserted by the
Finance Act, 2006
) would apply to all pending matters or would apply to matters arising with effect from assessment year 2006-07.
9.
Section 14A
has been inserted in the
Income Tax Act
,
Section 11
of the Finance Act, 2001, with retrospective effect from 1-4-1962, i.e., for and from assessment year 1962-63.
Section 14A
has been amended by
Section 10
of the Finance Act, 2002 and again by
Section 7
of the Finance Act, 2006.
Section 14A
as so amended reads now as under:
14A. Expenditure incurred in relation to income not includible in total Income.-(I) For the purposes of computing the total income under this Chapter, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income which does not form part of the total income under this Act.
(2) The assessing officer shall determine the amount of expenditure incurred in relation to such income which does not form part of the total income under this Act in accordance with such method as may be prescribed, if the assessing officer, having regard to the accounts of the assessee, is not satisfied with the correctness of the claim of the assessee in respect of such expenditure in relation to income which does not form part of the total income under this Act.-
(3) The provisions of Sub-section (2) shall also apply in relation to a case where an assessee claims that no expenditure has been incurred by him in relation to income which does not form part of the total income under this Act:
Provided that nothing contained in this section shall empower the assessing officer either to reassess under
Section 147
or pass an order enhancing the assessment or reducing a refund already made or otherwise increasing the liability of the assessee under
Section 154
, for any assessment year beginning on or before the Ist day of April, 2001.
(*Inserted as
Section 14A
(without numbering) in the
Income Tax Act
by the
Finance Act, 2001
with retrospective effect from 1-4-1962.** Inserted by the
Finance Act, 2006
and consequently all the clauses of
Section 14A
were numbered. -Inserted by the
Finance Act, 2002
.)
10. In the matter before us, we are not concerned with the proviso to
Section 14A
. We are concerned with Sub-section (1) (as originally inserted (without numbering of the sub-section) by the
Finance Act, 2001
with retrospective effect from 1-4-1962) and Sub-section (2)/(3) (inserted by the
Finance Act, 2006
with consequential numbering of the clauses of Section 14A) of Section 14A. The scope and effect of the insertion of Section 14A, with retrospective effect from 1-4-1962, in the
Income Tax Act
by the
Finance Act, 2001
have been explained in para 25 of Circular No. 14 of 2001 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, which reads as under:
25. No deduction for expenditure incurred in respect of exempt income against taxable income.
25.1 Certain incomes are not includible while computing the total income, as these are exempt under various provisions of the Act. There have been cases where deductions have been claimed in respect of such exempt income. This in effect means that the tax incentive given by way of exemptions to certain categories of income, is being used to reduce also the tax payable on the non-exempt income by debiting the expenses incurred to earn the exempt income against taxable income. This is against the basic principles of taxation whereby only the net income, i.e., gross income minus the expenditure, is taxed. On the same analogy, the exemption is also in respect of the net income. Expenses incurred can be allowed only to the extent they are relatable to the earning of taxable income.
25.2
Through Finance Act, 2001
, a new Section 14A has been inserted so as to clarify the intention of the Legislature since the inception of the
Income Tax Act, 1961
, that no deduction shall be made in respect of any expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income which does not form part of the total income under the
Income Tax Act
.
25.3 Vide Circular No. 11/2001, dated 23-7-2001, a direction was issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes that the assessments where the proceedings have become final before the first day of April, 2001 should not be re-opened under
Section 147
of the Act to disallow expenditure relatable to the exempt income by applying the provisions of
Section 14A
of the Act. This circular has been issued by the Board by exercising its powers to issue beneficial circular under
Section 119(2)(a)
of the Income Tax Act.
25.4 This amendment takes effect retrospectively from 1-4-1962 and accordingly, applies in relation to the assessment year 1962-63 and subsequent assessment years.
11.
Section 14A
clearly makes a distinction between exempt income and taxable income. It treats both of them as separate classes for computation of income after allocation of expenditure relating thereto and mandates that no deduction in respect of any expenditure shall  allowed against taxable income which is incurred in relation to exempt income. The underlying object is to compute both the exempt income and taxable income correctly, which is possible only after the expenditure incurred in relation thereto is allocated to them. In other words,
Section 14A
bars the deduction of expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income out of taxable income, as this would have the effect of artificially inflating the exempt income and thereby deflating the taxable income.
12. The prohibition for allowing the deduction under
Section 14A
for and from assessment year 1962-63 is "in respect of expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income" which does not form part of the total income. The term "expenditure" has been defined at page 598 of Black's Law Dictionary (Seventh Edition) thus: " 1. The act or process of paying out; disbursement. 2. A sum paid out." The term "expense" has been defined at the same page of the aforesaid dictionary as follows: "n. An expenditure of money, time, labour, or resources to accomplish a result; esp., a business expenditure chargeable against revenue for a specific period. - expense, vb. Cf. COST (1)." The "expense" has many forms, namely, accrued expense, administrative expense, business expense, capital expense, capitalized expense, current expense, deferred expense, educational expense, entertainment expense, extraordinary expense, fixed expense, funeral expense, general administrative expense, medical expense, moving expense, operating expense, ordinary and necessary expense, organizational expense, put-of-pocket expense, prepaid expense, travel expense. The term "expenditure" occurring in
Section 14A
would thus take in its sweep not only direct expenditure but also all forms of expenditure regardless of whether they are fixed, variable, direct, indirect, administrative, managerial or financial. The term "incur" has been defined at page 771 of the aforesaid dictionary as follows: "incur, vb. To suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense)." One of the meanings given to the word "relate" under the head "Law" at page 2534 in " The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary" (1993 Edition) is "Have some connection with, be connected to." The phraseology used in
Section 14A
prohibiting the deduction in respect of expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to exempt income is thus wide enough to cover all forms of expenses provided they have some connection with the exempt income. This is based on the principle that expenses must be allocated to that income to which they are connected to avoid distortions in the computation of both taxable as well as exempt income. This is also achieved by the matching principle of accountancy.
In
Taparia Tools Ltd. v. Jt. CIT
, the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court has explained the matching principle as under:
The mercantile system of accounting is based on accrual. Basically, it is a double entry system of accounting. Under the mercantile system of accounting, profits arising or accruing at the date of the transaction are liable to be taxed not withstanding the fact that they are not actually received. or deemed to be received under the Act. Under the mercantile system of accounting, therefore, book profits are liable to be taxed. The profits earned and credited in the books of account constitute the basis of computation of income. The system postulates the existence of tax in so far as monies due and payable by the parties to whom they are debited. Therefore, under the mercantile system of accounting, in order to determine the net income of an accounting year, the revenue and other incomes are matched with the cost of resources consumed (expenses). Under the mercantile system of accounting, this matching is required to be done on accrual basis. Under this matching concept, revenue and income earned during an accounting period, irrespective of actual cash in-flow, is required to be compared with expenses incurred during the same period, irrespective of actual out-flow of cash. In this case, the assessee is following the mercantile system of accounting. This matching concept is very relevant to compute taxable income....
13. It is difficult to accept the hypothesis that one can earn substantial dividend income without incurring any expenses whatsoever including management or administrative expenses. By same logic, it is equally difficult to accept that the only expenses involved in earning the dividend income are those incurred on collection of dividend or on encashing a few dividend warrants. A company cannot earn dividend without its existence and management. Investment decisions are very complex in nature. They require substantial market research, day-to-day analysis of market trends and decisions with regard to acquisition, retention and sale of shares at the most appropriate time. They require huge investment in shares and consequential blocking of funds.
It is well known that capital has cost and that element of cost is represented by interest. Besides, investment decisions are generally taken in the meetings of the Board of Directors for which administrative expenses are incurred. It is therefore not correct to say that dividend income can be earned by incurring no or nominal expenditure. This aspect of the matter has also received careful attention of Chennai Bench of this Tribunal in
Southern Petro Chemical Industries v. Dy. CIT
(2005) 3 SOT 157 (Chennai-Trib). After comprehensive consideration of all the relevant aspects of the case including the provisions of law, the Chennai Bench has held that investment decisions are very strategic decisions in which top management is involved and therefore proportionate management expenses are required to be deducted while computing the exempt income from dividend.
In
Harish Krishnakant Bhatt v. Income Tax Officer
(2004) 91 ITD 311 (Ahd.), the Ahmedabad Bench of this Tribunal has held that, the dividend income being exempt under
Section 10(33)
, the interest on capital borrowed for acquisition of relevant shares yielding such dividend cannot be allowed deduction by operation of
Section 14A
.
In
Dy. CIT v. SG Investments & Industries Ltd.
(2004) 89 ITD 44 (Cal.), the Calcutta Bench of this Tribunal has laid down two propositions: one, in view of
Section 14A
inserted in the
Income Tax Act
with retrospective effect from 1-4-1962, pro rata expenses on account of interest relatable to investment in shares for earning exempt income from dividend are to be disallowed against taxable income and only the net dividend income is to be allowed exemption after deducting the expenses; and two, the expression "expenditure incurred by the assessee in relation to income which does not form part of the total income" in
Section 14A
has to be given a wider meaning and would include both direct and indirect relationship between expenditure and exempt income.
Following the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
CIT v. United General Trust Ltd.
, the Calcutta Bench of the Tribunal has also held that the interest paid by the assessee being attributable to the money borrowed for the purpose of making the investment which yielded the dividend and other expenses incurred in connection with or for making or earning the dividend income can be regarded as expenditure incurred in relation to dividend income.
In
Everplus Securities & Finance Ltd. v. Dy. CIT
(2006) 101 ITD 151 (Del), the Delhi Bench of this Tribunal has held that merely because the assessee did not earn the dividend out of investment in certain shares does not imply that the provisions of
Section 14A
would not apply to that extent.
In
Asstt. CIT v. Premier Consolidated Capital Trust (I
). Ltd. (2004) 83 TTJ (Mum.) 843, the Mumbai Bench of this Tribunal has held that the assessing officer is justified in attributing a part of the financial and administrative expenses as expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income and disallowing the same in view of the provisions of
Section 14A
.
14. Keeping in view the provisions of
Section 14A
as also the aforesaid decisions of the co-ordinate Benches of this Tribunal, we hold that all expenses connected with the exempt income have to be disallowed under
Section 14A
regardless of whether they are direct or indirect, fixed or variable and managerial or financial in accordance with law. In this connection, the provisions of Sub-section (2)/(3) of
Section 14A
inserted by the
Finance Act, 2006
deserve to be noted.
15. The procedure for computation of disallowance has now been provided in Sub-sections (2) and (3) of
Section 14A
of the Income Tax Act. It is no longer open to the assessing officer to apply his discretion in computing the disallowance or make ad hoc disallowance under
Section 14A
. Substantive provisions are contained in Sub-section (1) of
Section 14A
prohibiting deduction in respect of expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income while procedural provisions regarding computation of the aforesaid disallowance are contained in Sub-sections (2) and (3) thereof. Sub-sections (2) and (3) seek to achieve the underlying object of
Section 14A(l)
that any expenditure incurred in relation to exempt income should not be allowed deduction. It is fairly well-settled by a catena of decisions that procedural provisions apply to all pending matters and that the rule against retrospectivity does not hit them.
16. In W.H. Cockerline and Co. v. IRC (1930) 16 TC I (CA) at 19, Lord Hanworth quoted with approval the following passage from the judgment of Sargant L. J.:
The liability is imposed by the charging section, namely,
Section 38
, the words of which are clear. The subsequent provisions as to assessment and so on are machinery only. They enable the liability to be quantified, and when quantified to be enforced against the subject, but the liability is definitely and finally created by the charging section and all the materials for ascertaining it are available immediately." In Halsbury's Law of England (Fourth edition, Vol. 23, paragraph 29), referring to the machinery provisions, it is stated: "It is important to distinguish between charging provisions, which impose the charge to tax, and machinery provisions, which provide the machinery for the quantification of the charge and the levying and collection of the tax in respect of the charge so imposed. Machinery provisions do not impose a charge or extend or restrict a charge elsewhere clearly imposed." In Kesoram Industries & Cotton Mills Ltd. v. CWT  Hon'ble Mr. Justice Shah observed: "
Section 7(2)
merely provides machinery in certain special cases for valuation of assets, and it is from the aggregate valuation of assets that the net wealth chargeable to tax may be ascertained.... This is an artificial rule adopted with a view to avoid investigation of a mass of evidence which it would be difficult to secure or, if secured, may require prolonged investigation." Though the aforesaid observation was part of the minority opinion, there is, however, nothing said to the contra in the majority view. In Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v. CTO (1981) 48 STC 466 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held: "It is settled law that a distinction has to be made by courts while interpreting the provisions of a taxing statute between charging provisions which impose the charge to tax and machinery provisions which provide the machinery for the quantification of the tax and the levying and collection of the tax so imposed. While charging provisions are construed strictly, machinery sections are not generally subject to a rigorous construction. The courts are expected to construe the machinery sections in such a manner that a charge to tax is not defeated." Bennions Statutory Interpretation (First edition, page 446, paragraph 191) lays down as follows: "Because a change made by the legislator in procedural provisions is expected to be for the general benefit of litigants and others, it is presumed that it applies to pending as well as future proceedings." At page 447, it is stated: "Procedure and practice is the mere machinery of law enforcement. As Ormrod L.J. said : 'The object of all procedural rules is to enable justice to be done between the parties consistently with the public interest'."
In
Jose Da Costa v. Bascora Sadashiva Sinai Narcornim
, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held at page 1849 of AIR 1975 SC. "Before ascertaining the effect of the enactments aforesaid passed by the Central Legislature on pending suits or appeals, it would be appropriate to bear in mind two well-established principles.
The first is that 'while provisions of a statute dealing merely with matters of procedure may properly, unless that construction be textually inadmissible, have retrospective effect attributed to them, provisions which touch a right in existence at the passing of the statute are not to be applied retrospectively in the absence of express enactment or necessary intendment' (See Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd. v. ITC AIR 1927 PC 242). The second is that a right of appeal being a substantive right the institution of a suit carries with it the implication that all successive appeals available under the law then in force would be preserved to the parties to the suit throughout the rest of the career of the suit.
There are two exceptions to the application of this rule, viz., (i) when by competent enactment such right of appeal is taken away expressly or impliedly with retrospective effect; and (ii) when the court to which appeal lay at the commencement of the suit stands abolished (See
Garikapatti Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhury
, and Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd v. Irving (1905) AC 369 (PC))" Halsbury's Laws of England (Fourth edition, Vol. 44, paragraph 925) states : "The presumption against retrospection does not apply to legislation concerned merely with matters of procedure or of evidence; on the contrary, provisions of that nature are to be construed as retrospective unless there is a clear indication that such was not the intention of Parliament."
All the aforesaid observations have been cited, with approval, by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in CWT v. Sharvan KumarSwarup & Sons .
17. In view of the aforesaid, we hold that the provisions for quantification of disallowance as contained in Sub-sections (2) and (3) of
Section 14A
are procedural and therefore apply to all pending matters. It is no longer open to the assessing officer to make disallowance according to his own discretion or on ad hoc basis. He is statutorily required to compute the disallowance in the manner provided by Sub-sections (2) and (3) of
Section 14A
. We therefore set aside the orders passed by the Commissioner (Appeals) and the assessing officer in this behalf and restore the matter to the assessing officer for a fresh examination and decision in the light of the provisions of
Section 14A
including Sub-sections (2) and (3) thereof, in accordance with law.
18. We are aware that the Rule' of Consistency requires us to follow the orders of the co-ordinate Benches of this Tribunal till there is a change in either the factual situation or the legal position. In the case before us, Sub-sections (2) and (3) of
Section 14A
were not available on the statute book when the orders were passed by this Tribunal in the assessee's own case for earlier two years. We have already held above that the aforesaid provisions have retroactive operation and therefore would apply to all pending matters. They cannot therefore be ignored. Besides, other relevant decisions rendered by this Tribunal in the cases cited supra were also not brought to the notice of this Tribunal at the time when department's appeal for earlier two years in the assessee's own case were decided.
19. In view of the foregoing, the appeal filed by the department is treated as allowed for statistical purposes.

Petitioner Counsel :- Ran Vijay Singh
Respondent Counsel :- G.A.

Hon'ble Raj Mani Chauhan,J.
Hon'ble Virendra Kumar Dixit,J.
Heard learned counsel for the petitioners, learned A.G.A and perused the FIR.
This petition under
Article 226
of the Constitution of India has been filed by
the petitioners for quashing the impugned FIR registered in case crime 761 of
2010, under Sections 2/3 (1) U.P. Gangsters Act at Police Station Makhi,
District Unnao and also for direction to the opposite parties not to arrest the
petitioners in pursuance to the said impugned FIR.
Learned counsel for the petitioners informs that petitioner No. 3 has already
been surrendered before the court concerned, therefore, he does not want to
press the petition on his behalf.
The petition is, therefore, dismissed as not pressed with regard to petitioner
No.3, Surendera.
The allegations made in the FIR disclose the commission of cognizable
offence mentioned therein, therefore no ground to quash the FIR lodged by
the complainant against the petitioners is made out.
The petition is, therefore, dismissed.
However, it is observed that in case the petitioners No. 1 and 2 appear before
the court concerned and apply for bail, the same shall be considered and
disposed of by the courts below expeditiously.

                    ------------------------------

                        J U D G M E N T
~~~~~~~~~~~

Balakrishnan Nair, J.
The 3rd respondent in the Original Petition is the appellant.

The 1st respondent is the writ petitioner.
2.    The brief facts of the case are the following:
The appellant was an employee of the 1st respondent Bank.

He was dismissed from service on 29.7.1972. In 1989, she filed

a Shop Appeal against the said order before the Deputy Labour

Commissioner. As per the provisions of
Section 18
of the Kerala

Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1960, the appeal

should have been filed within six months.            The appellate

authority has got the power to condone delay upto six months.

That means, in any event, the appeal should have been filed

within one year from the date of dismissal. But, it was filed in

1989. The appellate authority even before issuing notice to the

1st respondent condoned the delay.               The 1st respondent
W.A.No.209/2006                  2
appeared and contested.       The Shop Appeal was allowed by

Ext.P9 order. Challenging that order, the Original Petition was

filed by the 1st respondent. The learned Single Judge found that

the Shop Appeal filed after one year was not maintainable and

therefore quashed Ext.P9. Aggrieved by the said judgment of

the learned Single Judge, this Writ Appeal is filed.
2.   The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that

the bank has not challenged the order of the shop appellate

authority to condone the delay in filing the appeal. Secondly, it is

submitted that all the criminal cases filed against her by the

bank ended only by 1989. She was acquitted of all offences.
Only thereafter, she could have filed the appeal. Therefore, the

appellate authority rightly entertained the appeal, it is

submitted.
3.   The delay in filing the appeal was condoned before

issuing notice to the 1st respondent or filing written statement by

it. It appears to be an order passed at the time of presentation of

the appeal. If the 1st respondent is aggrieved by that order, it
W.A.No.209/2006                 3
need challenge it, if only, the final order in the appeal goes

against it. When Ext.P9 final order was passed against it, the 1st

respondent has challenged the order condoning delay also. For

challenging that order, the Bank need not approach this Court

separately.    So, the 1st contention fails. The 2nd contention is

also equally untenable. When the statute says that the appeal

should be filed within six months and if there is further delay the

appellate authority can condone the delay only up to six months,

any appeal filed thereafter is not maintainable. The fact that

some criminal cases were pending against the appellant is not a

valid ground to get over the bar of limitation under the statute.
In the result, the Writ Appeal fails and it is dismissed.
(K.BALAKRISHNAN NAIR, JUDGE)

                     husband are alleged for killing the deceased by administrating

                     poison. Submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that

                     marriage was love marriage. Petitioner and her husband have no

                     concern with the affair of the wife and husband if the marriage was

                     liability never can be extended to husband's parents. Petitioner's

                     M.A.C.A. No. 882 OF 2007
                           ---------------------
              Dated this the 21st day of August, 2008

                             JUDGMENT
This appeal is preferred against the award passed by the

Principal Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Kozhikode, in OP(MV)

2421/99. The claimant, aged 16 years, while travelling in a bus,

sustained injuries in a road accident.         It is noticed that she has

suffered a split in the anterior teeth. The Tribunal did not accept

Ext.A3, which was issued on 8.10.05, relating to some root canal

treatment. But the Tribunal gave reliance to Ext.A4 issued by the

Dental Department of the Medical College.
2. It has to be remembered that there was a split in the

teeth of a 16 year old girl and that she had undergone root canal

treatment. There was also suspicion of a fracture of the mandible.

So all these things would indicate that the girl had undergone

treatment in one or two hospitals. Taking note of the injury, that too

of a young girl on her teeth at the age of 16, I feel that an amount of

Rs.2,000/- can be enhanced towards loss of amenities and

enjoyment in life. On all other heads the Tribunal has awarded a just

and reasonable compensation.
MACA No. 882/07                   2
In the result, the MACA is partly allowed and the claimant is

entitled to an additional compensation of Rs.2,000/- with 6 % interest

on the said sum from the date of petition till realisation.       The

Insurance company is directed to deposit the amount within a period

of 60 days from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.

        HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE GURDEV SINGH

Present:-   None for the appellant.

            Mr. Kulbir Dalal, Advocate
            for respondent No.2.
                  ---


ORDER:
1.          This appeal has been preferred against order of

learned Single Judge, dismissing the writ petition against order of

the Labour Court declining to enforce award for backwages for

the period during which the workman was proved to be gainfully

employed.
2.          The appellant was employed with the management,

running a private hospital, where he worked from 1978 to 1996

when his services were terminated.       He raised an industrial

dispute against the order of termination, which was referred for

adjudication to the Labour Court. The Labour Court vide award

dated 26.3.2003, set aside the order of termination and directed

reinstatement of the workman with continuity of service and full
LPA No.720 of 2009                                                   2
backwages. It was held that no inquiry was held, which rendered

the termination of service to be illegal. Thereafter, the workman

filed an application under
Section 33-C(2)
of the Industrial

Disputes Act, 1947 for computation of monetary benefits flowing

from the award. The application was opposed with a plea that the

workman was gainfully employed with Kapil Vohra Eye Hospital,

Ambala City after his services were terminated and prior to his

reinstatement and for that period, he was not entitled to

backwages.
3.          The Labour Court vide order dated 6.12.2007 partly

allowed the application, except for the period he was gainfully

employed.
4.          The workman filed writ petition in this Court, giving

rise to the impugned order and submitted that once the award

was made in his favour, which became final, he was entitled to

wages for the entire period irrespective of his being gainfully

employed and thus, he could not be denied backwages from

19.6.1996 to 23.12.2004, during which he was gainfully

employed. Learned Single Judge rejected this claim, holding that

the claim of the workman was based on a fraud, on which ground

benefit of award could be partly declined inspite of its finality.
5.          On the last date of hearing, none appeared for the

appellant. Even today, none appears for the appellant. We have

perused the record.
6.          Learned Single Judge observed:-
LPA No.720 of 2009                                                  3
"XX           XX           XX           XX              X
                A perusal of the writ petition clearly shows that the
          workman has neither denied that he was gainfully
          employed from 2002 onwards nor has he pleaded that he
          was unemployed for the period for which the Labour Court
          has held him gainfully employed and on this ground
          rejected his claim of back-wages. What has been asserted in
          the writ petition by the petitioner is that the Labour Court
          could not go beyond the award and, therefore, the
          petitioner-workman was entitled to full back wages from
          19.6.1996 i.e. the date of termination till 23.12.2004 i.e. the
          day before his date of reinstatement. This clearly brings out
          the lust of the workman to gain undue benefit which he is
          not entitled to. The back wages are granted to a workman
          who due to his illegal termination by the employer
          remained unemployed or who is not gainfully employed.
          The Management has been able to prove that the workman
          was indeed gainfully employed from 2002 onwards, and,
          therefore, what is being claimed by the workman beyond
          2001 till 23.12.2004 was undue benefit which under law he
          cannot be held entitled to. The Labour Court while
          exercising its powers under
Section 33-C (2)
of the Act has
          not over-stepped the limits as prescribed under the Statute
          nor has it ventured out the limitations as culled out by the
          judgments referred to by the counsel for the petitioner or
          the Management. It has merely, while exercising its powers
          under
Section 33-C (2)
of the Act, given effect to the award
          passed by the Labour Cout on 26.3.2003 (Annexure P-1) on
          which the claim of the workman is based. Since the period
          for which the workman is entitled to back wages was not
          specified in the award, the Labour Court on the basis of the
          evidence led by the parties, has determined the period for
          which the workman had remained unemployed and has
LPA No.720 of 2009                                                 4
accordingly granted him the benefit of back wages for the
           said period. This, by no stretch of imagination, can be said
           to be beyond the jurisdiction of the Labour Court while
           exercising powers under
Section 33-C (2)
of the Act."
7.         It is, thus, clear that the workman was gainfully

employed for the period in dispute, for which backwages have

been declined.   Even though finality of an award may not be

disturbed and findings recorded may be resjudicata, we are

unable to find any error in the view taken by learned Single Judge

that the claim of the workman for the period he was proved to be

gainfully employed was vitiated by fraud, relying on judgment of

the Hon'ble Supreme Court in
S.P. Chengalvaraya Naidu (dead) by

L.Rs. v. Jagannath
(dead) by L.Rs. and others AIR 1994 SC Court
853.
8.         We, thus, do not find any ground to interfere with the

view taken by the learned Single Judge.
9.         The appeal is dismissed.

Madras High Court
Tmt. Kalachi @ Rajalakshmi vs State By The Deputy Superintendent Of ... on 22 March, 2006
Equivalent citations: 2006CRILJ2053
ORDER
 

M. Jeyapaul, J.
1. As against the order of dismissal passed in Crl.M.P.No.51 of 2006 filed under
Section 70(2)
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Crl.R.C.No.191 of 2006 has been preferred before the learned Special Judge No. 1/X Additional Judge, Chennai.
2. As against the order of dismissal passed in Crl.M.P.No.52 of 2006 filed under
Section 317
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Crl.R.C.No.192 of 2006 has been preferred before the learned Special Judge No. 1/X Additional Judge, Chennai.
3. As against the order of dismissal passed in Crl.M.P.No.53 of 2006 filed under
Section 205
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Crl.R.C.No.193 of 2006 has been preferred before the learned Special Judge No. 1/X Additional Judge, Chennai.
4. The petitioner has been arraigned as third accused in a case under
Section 13(2)
r/w
Section 13(1)(e)
of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and under
Section 109
of the Indian Penal Code r/w
Section 13(2)
r/w
Section 13(1)(e)
of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 launched totally against 20 accused.
5. The learned Special Judge, having taken cognizance of the aforesaid case, issued summons to all the accused to appear on 29.7.2005. The case thereafter stood posted to 23.9.2005 and then to 25.1.2006. As some of the accused were found absent, non-bailable warrants were issued after the petitions filed under
Section 317
of the Code of Criminal Procedure for condoning their absence were dismissed.
6. The other absentee accused, except the third accused, surrendered and the non-bailable warrants issued against them were recalled. The third accused, who has not chosen to show up before the Court in spite of the non-bailable warrant pending against her, has filed the aforesaid petitions under
Section 70(2)
of the Code of Criminal Procedure to recall the non-bailable warrant, under
Section 317
of the Code of Criminal Procedure to condone her absence and under
Section 205
of the Code of Criminal Procedure to dispense with her presence and permit her to appear by her Pleader.
7. The learned trial Judge, having adverted to the various authorities ruling the subject, returned a decision that the petitioner against whom non-bailable warrant is pending, cannot seek for the reliefs under
Sections 70(2)
,
317
and
205
of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
8. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner, who is an Octogenarian aged 87 years, is suffering from serious ailment and therefore she could not attend the Court.
9. The learned Public Prosecutor would submit that the petitioner is hale and healthy and she avoids receiving the copies of the documents and statements under
Section 207
of the Code of Criminal Procedure just to facilitate the other accused to drag on the matter.
10. On a perusal of the records, it is found that the case was originally registered way back in the year 1996, but the chargesheet was laid only in the year 2005. The trial Court has given ample opportunity for the present accused to appear before the Court to receive the copies of the documents and statements under
Section 207
of the Code of Criminal Procedure. But the accused has not turned up to receive the copies of documents and statements. The learned Special Judge has chosen to issue non-bailable warrant as against the petitioner to compel her presence before the Court to comply with the mandates of the provision under
Section 207
of the Code of Criminal Procedure in letter and spirit.
11. Of Course, the Court has ample power to dispense with the appearance/attendance of the accused on a particular hearing when the accused is represented by a Pleader under
Section 317
of the Code of Criminal Procedure and to dispense with the personal attendance of the accused and permit the accused to appear by her Pleader under
Section 205
of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
12. But the power of the Court to compel the attendance of the accused, even such concession or accommodation is granted to the accused whenever it is quite necessary for the purpose of an enquiry or trial of the case, is recognised under the scheme of the
Code of Criminal Procedure
.
13. When
Section 207
of the Code of Criminal Procedure specifically refers to furnishing of the copies of police report and other documents only to the accused, the presence of the accused when the matter has been posted for furnishing the copy of the police report and other documents is very much necessary.
14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in
V.K. Jain v. Union of India
2000 SCC (CRI) 302 and in
R. Annapurna v. Ramadugu Anantha Krishna Sastry
2004 SCC (Cri) 1135 recognised the power of the Court to compel the attendance of the accused whenever such attendance becomes imperatively needed. For receiving the copy of the police report and other documents and for answering the questionnaire framed under
Section 313
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the presence of the third accused is quite necessary.
15.
In a case where the accused undertook before the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the accused would not make any statement under
Section 313
of the Code of Criminal Procedure and would not raise any question of prejudice, if any, caused to him due to non-examination under
Section 313
of the Code of Criminal Procedure at any subsequent stage of trial, appeal or revision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in
Chandu Lal Chandraker v. Puran Mal
1988 SCC (Cri) 907, has directed to dispense with the presence of the accused at the time of making statement under
Section 313
of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
16. Even when the personal appearance of the accused is dispensed with under
Section 205
of the Code of Criminal Procedure whenever there is necessity for her personal attendance, the same can be enforced. In a case where the learned Judicial Magistrate adopted uniform policy of dismissing the petitions under
Section 205
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a Division Bench of this Court in A.S.K. Rama Iyer v. T. Kannan 1980 L.W. Crl. 31 has observed that such a learned Judicial Magistrate will refuse permission to the accused to appear by his Pleader as contemplated under
Section 205
of the Code of Criminal Procedure even if the accused is in death-bed, adhering blindly and undeviatingly to some unreasonable principle.
17. Only in an extreme and exceptional circumstance brought to the satisfaction of the Court that the accused is unable to appear before the Court, the Court may consider the request to dispense with his presence under
Section 205
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it has been ruled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Lily Begum v. Joy Chandra Nagbanshi 1994 SCC (Cri) 303.
18. It is a well settled proposition of law that the power to grant exemption from a personal appearance is totally discretionary and once the discretion is judiciously exercised by the trial Court, the same cannot be interfered with in revision merely because the accused feels aggrieved by the order passed by the trial Court.
19. There is a non-bailable warrant pending against the petitioner. The petitioner has to appear before the trial Judge to recall the warrant under
Section 70(2)
of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Unless she makes her appearance and the warrant is recalled, it would be a mockery of judicial process if her application filed either under Section 317 or under
Section 205
of the Code of Criminal Procedure is entertained.
20. The medical certificate produced by the petitioner to show that she is suffering from ailment at the ripe old age is seriously disputed by the respondent-police. Therefore, the petitioner has to appear and invoke
Section 70(2)
of the Code of Criminal Procedure to recall the warrant issued against her.
21. The Court holds that the hearing posted for furnishing copy of the final report and documents collected by the Investigating Agency is a very crucial hearing where the participation of the accused is contemplated under the scheme of the
Code of Criminal Procedure
. She cannot refuse to participate in such process of furnishing copy of final report and documents to her.
22. The petitions filed by the petitioner under
Sections 317
and
205
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, when the non-bailable warrant is pending against her, are found not sustainable. The trial of a case, which originated way back in the year 1996, cannot be further postponed on account of the non-participation and non-cooperation of the petitioner herein. She cannot delegate her function of receipt of copies furnished under
Section 207
of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the Advocate of her choice. She must be present to receive the copy of the final report and documents to set the trial process to move further.
23. The learned Special Judge has rightly concluded that all the three petitions as detailed above are not maintainable.
24. Such a common order passed by the learned trial Judge is found not tainted with any illegality or irregularity. No interference therefore is warranted.
25. In the result, Crl.R.C.Nos. 191 to 193 of 2006 stand dismissed. Consequently, connected criminal miscellaneous petitions also stand dismissed.

In
this matter the Hon'ble Court (Coram:Hon'ble Mr. Justice K.M. Thaker)
passed an order on 01.07.2008 and directed to examine the documents
and also identify the persons who have executed the said power of
attorney. Manojbhai Ranchodbhai Mahida and Ranchodbhai Jivabhai
Mahida appeared before me and they have given deposition on oath and
stated that Ranchodbhai Jivabhai Mahida given power of attorney to
Manojbhai Ranchodbhai Mahida. In the said matter  disputed property
in question and caveat was filed by the Learned Advocate Ms.
Subhadraben Patel and thereafter she was already relieved and
therefore on behalf of Mr. H. Ahmed was represented by legal aid and
he also relived and then Mr. Chirag was appointed through the legal
aid, even though he was also relieved.
The
applicant wants to plead as party in person and for which the
application was made by the applicant in this matter. Advocate has
not appeared on behalf of the applicant in which it cannot be
identified that who are Manojbhai Ranchodbhai Mahida and Ranchodbhai
Jivabhai Mahida. Only we can say that the oral depositions were given
on oath before this Court and it can be gather that the applicant
wants to  plead as party in person. So the matter be placed before
the  Hon'ble Court for necessary order.

Allahabad High Court
Dharmendra Nath And Ors. vs Jagdish Prakash on 6 October, 1975
Equivalent citations: AIR1976ALL107, AIR 1976 ALLAHABAD 107, 1976 ALL. L. J. 337, 1976 RENCR 375, (1976) 2 ALL LR 29
JUDGMENT

 

 Gopi Nath, J.
1. This is a plaintiffs' appeal arising out of a suit for ejectment and arrears of rent. The plaintiffs claimed a sum of Rs. 2924.00 on account of rent and damages in respect of the accommodation in dispute and they further prayed for the ejectment of the defendant on the ground that he had defaulted in the payment of the rent and did not pay the arrears even after the notice of demand dated 1-1-66. This notice was followed by a notice under
Section 106
of the T. P. Act dated 26-2-1966. Both the notices were given by all the four plaintiffs appellants. The trial court decreed the suit in its entirety. The lower appellate Court has dismissed the claim for ejectment but decreed the recovery of arrears.
2. The facts leading up to the present appeal are as follows:
One Triloki Nath was the owner of the accommodation in dispute. He sold it in favour of one Mahabir Pra-sad. Mahabir Prasad by a deed of sale dated 16-6-1961 transferred the property to Smt. Prabha, Km. Veena, Km. Reshmi and Km. Nirja. Km. Veena, Km. Reshmi and Km. Nirja are the daughters of Smt. Prabha and were minors on the date of the sale. By a sale deed dated 1-11-1965 Smt. Prabha and her three daughters sold the property to the plaintiffs. The deed was executed by Smt. Prabha and one Dr. Bhagwat Dutt, the father of Smt. Prabha, and the maternal grandfather of the three minor daughters of Smt Prabha as their de facto guardian. On 16-12-68 the three minors having attained majority ratified the sale deed dated 1-11-1965 and executed a deed of ratification in favour of the plaintiffs. On the basis of these two deeds the plaintiffs claimed to be the owners of the property in dispute. The plaintiffs however shortly after the sale deed dated 1-11-1965 issued the notice of demand against the defendant for the payment of rent. The defendant had been occupying the premises it appears, since 1961, and had been paying rent to the successive owners by cheque. The notice of demand was served on the defendant on 3-1-1966. By a registered letter dated 29-1-1966 the defendant sent a reply to the plaintiffs enclosing a cheque for the rent demanded in full satisfaction of the dues. In this letter the defendant clearly admitted the plaintiffs as his landlords and stated that the cheque was being sent in compliance to the demand for arrears of rent and in full satisfaction thereof. This letter however was not delivered to the plaintiffs It was alleged by the plaintiffs that this was due to the negligence of the postman who endorsed on the envelop that the letter could not be delivered being addressed in the names of four persons. The rent having thus not been received by the plaintiffs within the prescribed time they issued the notice dated 16-2-1966 under
Section 106
of the T. P. Act terminating the defendants tenancy and requiring him to hand over possession of the premises. This notice was served on 3-3-1966. The defendant having failed to vacate the premises the suit giving rise to this appeal was filed, for ejectment and arrears of rent and damages.
3. The defence delivered was that the defendant had sent the rent through cheque within the time prescribed by the notice dated 1-1-1966. The cheque was enclosed with a letter under registered cover addressed in the name of the four plaintiffs. In the letter it was stated that since all the four plaintiffs were the landlords and the rent was demanded by all of them a cheque drawn in favour of all, was being sent. It was thus pleaded that the defendant had not defaulted in the payment of rent and had sent the same within the prescribed period. The suit on the basis of default therefore could not be maintained. It was further pleaded that the notice to quit was defective, in that the original sale deed dated 1-11-1965 executed by Smt. Prabha and Sri Bhagwat Dutt on behalf of the three minor daughters of Smt. Prabha could not pass a valid title to the entire property, the transfer by a de facto guardian of a minor being invalid in law. The sale deed to the extent of the interest of the minors was thus void. The deed of ratification could also not validate the transaction the same being ab initio void. The plaintiffs consequently were owners of the property to the extent of one-fourth share only and they thus could not terminate the defendant's tenancy from the entire premises. The notice to quit the entire premises was thus invalid, since the case has been argued with reference only to these two points it is unnecessary to refer to the other pleas raised.
4. The trial Court held that the remittance of the rent by cheque was no payment in the eyes of law. The defendant consequently was in default of payment of rent and liable to ejectment on that ground. It further held that the notice to quit was valid. The suit was accordingly decreed for ejectment as also for the arrears claimed.
5. On appeal the lower appellate court allowed the appeal in part, dismissing the claim for ejectment while affirming the decree for the recovery of arrears on the findings that the remittance of rent by cheque was no payment in the eyes of law and since it never reached the plaintiffs the defendant was a defaulter. The defendant consequently was held in default of the payment of rent.
6. The claim for ejectment was however dismissed on the ground that the sale deed dated 1-11-1966 being void in so far as it concerned the three minor girls, the deed of ratification dated 16-12-1968 could not have the effect of validating the same. The plaintiffs consequently were owners of only one-fourth of the property and could not terminate the defendant's tenancy from the entire premises. The notice to quit was thus held invalid, and the relief of ejectment refused on that ground. The claim for arrears was decreed on the finding that the landlords never received the rent and were entitled to recover the same from the defendant.
7. The plaintiffs have filed this appeal against the decree refusing ejectment while the defendant has filed a cross-objection against the decree directing recovery of arrears.
8. As regards the plaintiffs title to the property it seems to me that the defendant had by his letter dated 29-1-1966 clearly admitted the plaintiffs as his landlords in respect of the entire premises. Even if there was some defect in the original deed of sale dated 1-11-1966 the defendant has attorned to the plaintiffs in unequivocal terms by his letter dated 29-1-1966. He sent the entire arrears claimed and said that it was in satisfaction of the dues. In view of the recitals in the letter dated 29-1-1966 I am clearly of the opinion that the defendant is now estopped from challenging the title of the plaintiffs in respect of the premises. It is unnecessary in the circumstances to decide the question of the validity of the sale deed dated 1-11-1965 and the effect of the ratification made on 16-12-1968.
9. The only question surviving for decision is whether the remittance of the rent by cheque with the covering letter dated 29-1-1966 constituted a valid tender in the eyes of law. Triloki Nath, father of the plaintiffs appellants was the original owner of the permises in dispute. It has come in the statement of the plaintiff Dharmendra Nath that he used to accept rent by cheques. The court below has disbelieved him as regards his statement that after the purchase of the property the plaintiffs stopped the defendant from paying rent by cheques. Payment by cheque was thus an acceptable mode of payment of rent and the plaintiffs had not forbidden the defendant from continuing that mode. It may be observed here that on the transfer of the property by Triloki Nath to Mahabir Pra-sad, Triloki Nath was appointed a Theka-dar for collection of rent. He continued to receive the rent by cheque. After the sale of the premises by Mahabir Prasad to Smt. Prabha and her three daughters it is again accepted that Triloki Nath continued as a Thekedar and realised the rent on their 'behalf. It is further established that Triloki Nath received' rent through cheques even during this period. Exh. A-2 is a list of counter-foils filed by the defendant to prove payment of rent by cheques to the landlords. It shows a payment of Rs. 2,130,00 by cheque dated 24-8-1964 to Triloki Nath. This refers to the period when Mahabir was owner of the property. Another counter-foil of a cheque in favour of Triloki Nath is for a sum of Rs. 1,732.50 and this refers to the period when Smt. Prabha and her three daughters were the owners. The defendant has further produced his Cash Book which is Exh,. A-10 to show that cheque was an accepted mode of payment of rent. It is true that after the property had been purchased by the present plaintiffs no tender of rent was made by cheque prior to 29-1-1966. The property was purchased by the plaintiffs on 1-11-1965. The demand for rent was made shortly thereafter by the notice dated 1-1-1966. Compliance to the demand was made by sending a cheque for Rs. 1,102.50 in the name of the four plaintiffs under a registered cover. The registered letter was however returned with an endorsement that it could not be delivered being in the name of four persons. Learned counsel for the respondent has produced Post and Telegraph Manual Vol. V, First Edition which contains Rule 117 to the following effect:
"Letters addressed to more than one person should be forwarded to destination. They may be delivered to any one of the persons whose names they bear, but should ordinarily be offered to them in the order in which the names appear on the cover. In the case of a registered letter, the receipt should be drawn out in the names of the addressees."
Learned counsel has informed me that this rule has not undergone any change so far. No contrary rule has been cited on behalf of the appellants, A registered letter addressed in the name of more than one person, should according to this rule be delivered to the addressee. The letter in the circumstances was wrongly returned. Whether it was at the instance of the plaintiffs appellants or on behalf of the post office the defendant was not to suffer on that account. The cheque in the circumstances was a normal postal remittance, which ought to have reached the addressee in due course. The question is whether it was a valid tender.
10. Section 3 of the U. P. Temporary Control of Rent and Eviction Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act) does not prescribe any particular mode of payment of rent. See
Jagannath Prasad v. Smt. Chandrawati
, 1969 All LJ 881 = (AIR 1970 All 309) (PB). Any mode of

payment permissible under law would thus be a valid mode for the purposes of
Section 3
of the Act. That provision is intended to give a protection to the tenant to save his tenancy ,by tendering the arrears of rent within a month of the notice of demand. The provision has to be construed in a manner to advance the intention of the legislature and not to penalise the tenant.
See
Bhikha Lal v. Munna Lal
, 1973 All LJ 236= (AIR 1973 All 128). A tenant is thus saved from ejectment if he remits rent in a manner permissible under law within a reasonable period of the notice of demand. He would not be liable to ejectment if it does not reach in time or has been returned to him.
Sec. 3
is attracted only when a tenant is in default and not when the rent is in arrears. There is a clear distinction between a tenant being in arrears (of rent and being in arrears.)
See Mst Indrasani v. Din Ali (1968 All WR (HC) 167) (FB). Thus if the defendant had bona fide remitted the rent by cheque and had believed that in the normal course it would reach the landlord he had discharged his part so for as
Section 3
was concerned.
Bhikha Lal v. Munna Lal
, 1974 All LJ 470 = (AIR 1974 AH 366) (FB) it was held that where a tenant sends rent through money order within the time prescribed by the notice of demand, he would not be liable to ejectment even though the money order reaches the payee beyond the prescribed period. It was further held that the post office is an agent of the payee and in certain circumstances of both the payee and the remitter.
In Mrs. Indrasani v. Din Ali (supra) it w,as held that a remittance once refused by the landlord did not oblige the tenant to send it afresh, and he could not be treated as in arrears for eviction for the period for which the remittance had been made. The Full Bench in this connection observed that there was a distinction between a tenant being in arrears of rent and the rent being in arrears. The observation was as follows:
"There is a clear distinction between a case in which a tenant is in arrears of rent and a case in which the rent is in arrears."
The defendant in this case sent the cheque for a sum of Rs. 1,102.50 in full satisfaction of the demand under a bona fide belief that remittance by cheque being one of the accepted modes of payment, the same would be acceptable to the plaintiffs in discharge of the liability. Particularly when the landlords were no other than the sons of Triloki Nath who had been accepting rent through cheques. The demand was made by a registered letter. The cheque consequently was also sent  by registered post.
11. In Parasram v. Damadi Lal (1971 Ren CJ 117) (Madh. Pra.) it was held that in a developed society payment by cheque has become a more convenient mode of discharging one's obligation. In that case the arrears of rent were sent by cheque and the same was held a valid tender, R. J. Bhave, J. observed "It is no doubt true that issuance of a cheque does not operate as discharge of the obligation unless it is encashed, and it is treated as a conditional payment. Yet, in my view, this is a sufficient tender of arrears if the cheque is not dishonoured. In the present day society I am of the view, implied agreement should be inferred that if the payment is made by a cheque that payment of cheque would be accepted".
In
Commr. of Income-tax Bombay South, Bombay v.  Ogale Glass Works Ltd., Ogale Wadi
(AIR 1954 SC 429 at p. 432) it was observed :
"That a sum of money may be received in more ways than one cannot be doubted. It may be received by the transfer of coins or currency notes or a negotiable instrument which represents and produces cash and is treated as such by businessmen."
Payment by cheque was thus held a valid mode of discharging one's liability. Sending the same through post was considered a normal mode of remittance.
12.
In
Bhikha Lal v. Munna Lal
(supra) this Court held that there was no material difference or distinction between a payment by cheque and one made by money order. That was a case where payment was made by money order and the Full Bench on the strength of the authorities relating to payment by cheque came to the conclusion that a money order and a cheque stood at par so far as the discharge of a tenant's liability as regards the payment of rent was concerned. Learned counsel for the appellant urged that payment by cheque was a valid discharge only if there existed an agreement between the parties or there was a usage or custom to that effect. In the instant case it has already been seen that payment by cheque was a usual mode of payment between the defendant and the earlier landlords of the premises. This mode was an accepted mode, so far as those landlords were concerned.
In Bhag-wan Devi Goel v. Shushila Rani (1961 All LJ 155) it was held that payment by cheque to constitute a valid tender, depended upon the custom of the locality and the previous practice between the parties. So far as the present plaintiffs are concerned the question of practice did not arise as the demand was made immediately after they became owners of the premises. This practice, however, had been clearly established as between the defendant and the earlier landlords.
In
Commr. of Income-tax, Bombay v.  Ogale

Glass Works Ltd.
(supra) it was observed that the course of business, usage in general and the surrounding circumstances of a particular case determine the intention of the parties   as    regards    discharge    of liabilities .by ;payment by cheque.
To the same effect are the observations    in    the Full     Bench     case   of
Bhikha   Lal   v. Munna   Lal
(1974   All   LJ   470) = (AIR 1974   All   366).     It     has   already   been seen that the plaintiffs had been disbelieved when they stated that they had forbidden the defendant from sending    cheques towards payment  of rent.      The    plaintiffs had not restrained the defendant from doing so. The prevalent practice was to send it that way and the defendant could bona fide adhere to it until specifically forbidden to do so. The payment was thus bona fide made. It has to be noticed that on the return of the registered letter dated 29-1-1966 the defendant    again    sent    another cheque for the same amount    of    Rupees 1,102.50 np. to the plaintiff appellants on 12-2-1966. The registered    letter    accompanying this remittance stated that since the "earlier letter had   been   returned   a cheque was being sent again so    that   no    liabilities may remain   outstanding.    The cheque along with the letter was received by the landlords but they   returned   the same on the ground that the tender was made beyond time. It is significant to note that in their letter dated    26-2-1966    returning the cheque the plaintiffs   did   not take any exception the tender being made by cheque or the cheque being drawn in favour of four persons. The only ground taken was that they had received it   late. It can therefore be assumed    that    there w,as no objection to the tender being made by cheque. This fact further receives support from the allegations   in   the   plaint, where the defendant was    categorised   a defaulter only on the ground of the cheque being sent -beyond time.   The   plaint again does not take any exception to   the payment of rent by cheque.    The    defendant in the circumstances was fully justified in remitting the rent  by cheque   and until that mode was specifically forbidden the cheque was ,a valid    tender   towards payment of rent.
Learned counsel for the appellant invited my attention to  Mohan-lal v.  Kanwar  Sen  (AIR  1954 All 480).  In that case it was held that payment of rent by Bank draft was not a valid discharge of the liability unless there was an    express or implied agreement to that effect between the parties. The facts of that case are clearly distinguishable. Payment    by bank draft was not a prevalent practice in that case, nor was there   any   agreement alleged to that effect. The plaintiff had on an earlier occasion clearly forbidden   the defendant from sending a Bank Draft towards payment of rent and had  directed him to send the same by   money   order.
After this specific direction it was not open to the defendant to send the rent by Bank Draft. In these circumstances the Bench took the view that remittance of rent by a Bank Draft was neither a valid tender nor a valid payment.
13. In the instant case, the plaintiffs had never forbidden the defendant from making payment by cheque. Mohan Lal's case thus does not help the plaintiffs, the remittance by cheque, in the circumstances, was a valid tender. The post office was an agent of the payee. The rent was sent on 29-1-1966 in the first instance, well within time. If the landlords did not accept or receive the same, the defendant was not to be penalised for it. He remitted the amount again by another cheque on 11-2-1966. His bona fides are clearly established. He could not be treated as a defaulter and ejected on that ground. The decree of the lower appellate court refusing ejectment has to be affirmed though on a different ground.
14. The cross-objection challenges the recovery of rent of the entire premises by the plaintiffs. According to the defendant they were entitled to a part of the rent only as the sale deed in their favour in respect of the interest of the minors, was invalid.
15. It has already been found that the defendant had accepted the plaintiffs as landlords of the entire premises v:de his letter dated 29-1-1966. The plaintiffs were accordingly entitled to recover the rent of the entire premises. The cross-objection thus has no force and is liable to be dismissed.
16. In the result the appeal and the cross-objection fail and are dismissed. But in the circumstances of the case I make no order as to costs.

JUDGMENT
 

 Viney Mittal, J.
1. The defendants, State of Punjab and others, having lost before the learned first Appellant Court have approached this Court through the present regular second appeal.
2. The facts which emerge from the record show that plaintiff-Budha Singh filed a suit for declaration to the effect that the Order dated November 23, 1993 passed by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Gurdaspur, defendant No. 2 vide which the plaintiff was retired from service prematurely was illegal and bad. He also challenged the order dated July 14, 1994 vide which the Director General of Police, Punjab rejected the subsequent request made by the plaintiff for withdrawal of his resignation/request for premature retirement.
3. The plaintiff pleaded that he was enlisted as a Constable with the Punjab Police with effect from March 14, 1972. In 1991, the son of the plaintiff was murdered by the terrorists. It was claimed by him that on account of the aforesaid, fact, the plaintiff was mentally disturbed and therefore, he filed an application on November 18, 1993 seeking his voluntary retirement. The aforesaid request of the plaintiff was accepted on November 23, 1993 by the Senior Superintendent of Police. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed an application on February 16, 1994 withdrawing the aforesaid request made by him on November 18, 1993. The aforesaid request made by the plaintiff was forwarded to the Director General of Police, Punjab. Since in the meantime, the Senior Superintendent of Police had already accepted the request of the plaintiff, therefore, the Director General of Police on July 14, 1994 rejected the request of the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed that the aforesaid Orders passed by the Senior Superintendent of Police and the Director General of Police were illegal and bad. Consequently, he filed the suit in question.
4. The defendants contested the claim of the plaintiff. It was maintained by them that while filing the application on November 18, 1993, the plaintiff had requested that he be retired with effect from December 1, 1993. Consequently, the Senior Superintendent of Police accepted the aforesaid request of the plaintiff on November 23, 1993 and the plaintiff was ordered to be retired with effect from December 1, 1993. In these circumstances, the defendants maintained that any subsequent application of the plaintiff on February 16, 1994 withdrawing his original request was wholly without any basis, inasmuch as the original request of the plaintiff had already been accepted in the meantime. Consequently, the Director General of Police had rightly dismissed the request of the petitioner on July 14, 1994.
5. The suit of the plaintiff was dismissed by the learned Trial Court. The learned trial Court found it as a fact that when the plaintiff had filed an application, Ex.Dl, on February 18, 1993, then, he had specifically mentioned therein that he be allowed to retire with effect from December 1, 1993. Accordingly, the Senior Superintendent of Police had accepted his request and allowed him to retire with effect from December 1, 1993, vide Order Ex.Pl. The said order was to take effect from December 1, 1993 as desired by the plaintiff. It was also held by the learned Trial Court that since the aforesaid request of the plaintiff had already been accepted by the authorities, therefore, the plaintiff could not be heard to claim that he had withdrawn the aforesaid request subsequently on February 16, 1994.
6. The plaintiff took up the matter in appeal.
7. The learned first Appellate Court on reconsideration of the controversy, allowed the appeal filed by the plaintiff. It was held that since the Order dated November 23, 1993 had been passed by the Senior Superintendent of Police within a period of three months from the request of the plaintiff and the aforesaid period of three months was, in fact, to be treated as notice period, therefore, when the plaintiff h ad withdrawn the aforesaid request within the aforesaid three months, then he could not be voluntarily retired and the subsequent request made by the plaintiff was liable to be accepted. Consequently, the appeal of the plaintiff was allowed and as a result thereof, the suit filed by the plaintiff was decreed; It was held that the plaintiff was entitled to all service benefits and continuity of service including pay. and allowances from the date he had been retired from service.
8. At this stage, it may be noticed that the present regular second appeal had been filed in the year 1998 under the provision of Section 41 of the Punjab Courts Act, 1980. A Full Bench of this Court in the case of
Ghana v. Ram Devi
. A.I.R. 1978 Punjab & Haryana 137 had taken a view that in view of the aforesaid local law
(Punjab Courts Act
), the amended provisions of
Section 100
of the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended in 1976, were not applicable to the second appeals filed in this Court. Accordingly, no substantial question of law was framed nor the aforesaid regular second appeal was admitted on any such substantial question of law.
However, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of
Kulwant Kaur and Ors. v. Gurdial Singh Mann
(dead) by LRs and Ors.  has held that after the amendment
of the Code of Civil Procedure
in the year 1976, thereby amending Section 100,
Section 41
of the Punjab Courts Act had become redundant and repugnant to the Central Act i.e.
Code of Civil Procedure
and, therefore, was to be ignored and, therefore, the second appeal shall only lie to this Court under Section 100 of the amended
Code of Civil Procedure
on a substantial question of law,
10.
In view of the law
laid down by
the Apex Court in
Kulwant Kaur
's case (supra), during the course of arguments, the following substantial questions of law have arisen for consideration:
A. Whether the learned first Appellant Court had misread the document Ex.Dl, the application filed by the plaintiff on November 18, 1993, wherein he had specifically stated that he be retired with effect from December 1 , 1993 and on account of the aforesaid misreading, whether the findings recorded by the learned first Appellate Court are judicially perverse and liable to be set aside?
B. As to whether the plaintiff having never served a notice for three months while making the original request on November 18, 1993 and an order having been passed on November 23, 1993 accepting the a foresaid request, still the aforesaid notice period could be presumed to be operative and whether on account of the aforesaid fact, the plaintiff could withdraw his request on November 16, 1994?
11. I have heard Shri D.S. Jandiala, learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab appearing for the appellants and Shri P.S. Goraya, learned Counsel appearing for the respondent, and with their assistance have gone through the record.
12. Shri D.S. Jandiala, learned Additional Advocate General, Punjab has vehemently argued that t he learned first Appellate Court has completely misread the application , Ex.Dl dated November 18, 1993 filed by the plaintiff wherein it had been subsequently mentioned by the plaintiff that he wanted voluntary retirement and pension with effect from December 1, 1993. It is on account of the aforesaid fact that the said application was accepted by the Senior Superintendent of Police on November 23, 1993 and the order of voluntary retirement was to take effect with effect from December 1, 1993. The learned Counsel argued that on account of the aforesaid misreading, the findings recorded by the learned first Appellate Court cannot be legally sustained since they are judicially perverse. It has been argued by the learned Counsel that admittedly the application dated November 16, 1994 withdrawing the earlier request was filed by the plaintiff much after the order had been passed by the Senior Superintendent of Police on November 23, 1993 and therefore, the said request could not be entertained and the same was validly and rightly rejected on July 14, 1994 by the Director General of Police. It has further been contended that since the plaintiff had not served any notice for three months, therefore, the order was passed on November 23, 1993 by the Senior Superintendent of Police and the plaintiff could not be heard to claim that he had withdrawn the original request within the notice period.
13. As against this, Shri P.S. Goraya, learned Counsel for the respondent has argued that the notice period was mandatory under the Rules. A person seeking voluntary retirement was required to serve a three months' notice and therefore within the aforesaid period of three months, the person making request could always change his mind and withdraw the request. According to Shri P.S. Goraya, once the plaintiff had filed an application on November 16, 1994 withdrawing his request within the notice period, then the order dated November 23, 1993 was liable to be withdrawn and in any case, his subsequent request could not be rejected by the .Director General of Police on July 4, 1994. It has also been argued that in any case, a perusal of Ex.Dl shows that the foot note to the application has been added later on wherein it had been mentioned that the pension/voluntary retirement was to take effect from December 1, 1993. Shri Goraya has argued that the aforesaid foot note was not shown to be in the hand writing of the plaintiff and that the defendants had not led any evidence to show that the aforesaid foot note was written by the plaintiff in the original application.
In support of his contention, Shri P.S. Goraya has relied upon two judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in
Balram Gupta v. Union of India and Anr.
and
J.N. Srivastava v. Union of India and Anr.
.
14. I have thoughtfully considered the rival contentions of the learned Counsel for the parties.
15. The facts which emerge from the record clearly show that the plaintiff had originally filed the application, Ex.Dl, on November 18, 1993. A perusal of the application shows that there is a foot note added and in the aforesaid foot note, it has been mentioned that the aforesaid voluntary retirement/pension be given to the plaintiff with effect from December 1, 1993, although during the course of the arguments, learned Counsel for the plaintiff has argued that the aforesaid foot note was not in his hand writing. I am afraid, neither any such plea was taken by the plaintiff in the plaint nor any evidence to that effect was led by him during the course of trial. It was for the plaintiff to prove his case that the original application dated November 18, 1993 was to take effect after the expiry of three months as per Rules applicable to him. In these circumstances, when the plaintiff made a request that he be voluntarily retired with effect from December 1, 1993 on account of his personal reasons and mental condition, then it was natural for the Senior Superintendent of Police to have accepted the aforesaid request by passing the order dated November 23, 1993. Nothing has been shown by the plaintiff that the aforesaid request was to take effect after the notice period.
16. No such notice was served by the plaintiff nor any such notice was demanded by the respondents. The requirement of the notice therefore in these circumstances, stood waived when the Senior Superintendent of Police accepted the aforesaid request of the plaintiff on November 23, 1993.
17. There is no quarrel with regard to proposition of law that if a notice of three months is given by an employee as required under the Rules and the aforesaid request is withdrawn by him within the aforesaid notice period, then even if an order allowing him to retire has been passed in the meantime, still the employee was well within his rights to withdraw the said request within the notice period. The law
laid down by
Apex Court in
Balram Gupta
's case and
J.N. Srivastava
's case is only to that effect. However, as noticed in the present case, there was no notice ever served by the plaintiff. In these circumstances, the aforesaid authorities are not attracted to the present case.
18. No other point has been urged.
19. In view of the discussion above, the aforesaid questions of law, A and B, are answered in favour of the defendants/appellants and against the plaintiff/respondent. As a consequence of the answer to two substantial questions of law, the present appeal is allowed. The judgment and decree of the learned first Appellate Court are set aside. The suit filed by the plaintiff shall stand dismissed.
20. However, there shall be no order as to costs.

Punjab-Haryana High Court
Mohinder Singh vs Commissioner Under Workmen ... on 27 September, 1990
Equivalent citations: 1992ACJ581, (1992)101PLR439
JUDGMENT
 

Amarjeet Chaudhary, J.
1. The petitioner who is a Mechanic in the respondent department had filed the present petition under
Articles 226
and
227
of the Constitution of India for quashing the order dated 29th October, 1987 passed by the Commissioner under the
Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923
(for short 'the Act') and for a further direction to decide the claim of the petitioner on merits.
2. The facts of the case are that the petitioner while working as a Mechanic with the respondent department at Sonepat Depot had received personal injuries by an accident which took place on 13th April, 1984 in the course of employment. On the day of the accident, when the petitioner was repairing the bus, the Jack slipped and its Chasis fell on the left hand of the petitioner as a result of which he received serious permanent injury rendering three fingers of his left hand permanently disabled. Thus the petitioner subtained 40 per cent disability. The notice of this accident was given by the petitioner to the General Manager, Haryana Roadways, Sonepat on 12th June, 1984. As the respondent department did not pay any compensation to the petitioner, he was left with no alternative but to file the application for compensation against the Haryana State Roadways, Sonepat Depot on 31st July, 1986 (Annexure P/2) wherein it was stated that he met with an accident on 13th April, 1984 and suffered 40 per cent permanent disability and was thus entitled to get compensation of Rs. 10,800. His claim was registered by the office, in the Register of claims and a notice was issued to the respondent for proceeding with the case. The respondent filed written statement and the following issue was framed.
Whether the claim of the petitioner is barred by time and if so, what effect ?
The Commissioner under the
Workmen's Compensation Act
refused to entertain the claim on the ground that the same was not made within the period of limitation i.e. two years and rejected the same without any proceedings.
3. The writ petition was admitted on 13th May, 1988 but the respondent had not filed any written statement. The facts of the case thus remain uncontroverted. Moreso, at the time of final hearing of the petition, none appeared on behalf of the respondent-state.
4. It was urged that the petitioner had given notice of accident on 12th June, 1984 as per provisions contained in
Section 10(1)
of the Workmen Compensation Act and kept on waiting that the Department would consider his claim sympathetically while working with them. Therefore, it was itself a good ground for extension of limitation.
5. I have considered the submissions made at the bar and perused the paper-book.
6. The petitioner continued to be in the employment of the respondents on the same salary even after the occurrence He had given notice of the accident on 12th June, 1984 copy of which is annexed as Annexure P-1 to the writ petition as required under Rule 10(1) of the
Workmen's Compensation Act
and had waited considerably with a hope that his employer would consider his claim sympathetically. The fact that the petitioner continued to be in the employment of the respondents had sufficient cause for not preferring the claim within the prescribed period as he continued to draw the same wages even after sustaining injury during the course of employment and remained under the belief that his employer would settle his claim. In Said Ahmad v. North Eastern Railway, Lahore, A. I. R. 1940 Lah. 227, it was held that where a workman is re-employed after the accident by the same employer in the same workshop, this fact is itself sufficient cause for not making an application under the
Workmen's Compensation Act
within the period of limitation.
Similarly in
Kesoram Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Bal Gobind, A. I. R.
1953 Calcutta 667, that the workman, whose working capacity was reduced during employment was allowed to continue to be in the employment on lighter job. After some time he was asked to return to his original job on which he had become incapacitated. The Commissioner took the view that the workman had sufficient cause not to provoke a conflict with his employer and not to prefer claim within the limitation so long as his interests were not prejudicially affected and so long as he was receiving a kind of compensation in the shape of lighter work on the same wages.
7. In view of the foregoing reasons and well settled propositions of law, this writ petition is allowed and the impugned order dated 29th October, 1987 (Annexure P-4) is set aside and the case is remanded back to Respondent No. 1, for deciding the claim of the petitioner on merits expeditiously. The parties are left to bear their own costs.
8. The petitioner is directed to appear before the Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation Act, Sonepat on 30th October, 1990, for directions.

Income Tax Appellate Tribunal - Mumbai
Alcan Inc. vs Dy Director Of Income-Tax ... on 30 April, 2007
Equivalent citations: (2007)112TTJ(MUM)328
ORDER
O.K. Narayanan, Accountant Member
1. These are the cross appeals filed by the assessee and by the revenue, respectively. The relevant assessment year is 2001-02. These appeals are directed against the order of the Commissioner (Appeals)-XXXI, Mumbai, dated 15-12-2004 and arise out of the assessment completed under
Section 143(3)
of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ('Act').
2. The assessee is a Canadian company. The assessee had, over a period of time, acquired 3,88,44,324 shares of an Indian company by name Indian Aluminum Co. Ltd. (Indal). The shares acquired by the assessee-company are of the following categories :
(i) Shares acquired between 1938 and 1968 in Canadian Dollars (CAD);
(ii) Shares acquired in August 1998 in American Dollars (USD); and
(iii) Bonus shares allowed between 1944 and 1996.
3. During the previous year relevant to the assessment year under appeal, the assessee-company sold the entire Indal shares to another company Hindalco Industries Ltd. The shares were sold on at an agreed price of Rs. 190 per share. The long-term capital gains arising oui: of the above transaction was reported by the assessee-company at Rs. 317,71,30,910 in its return of income filed for the impugned assessment year 2001-02. The capital gains tax was computed at Rs. 31,77,13,091 at the rate of 10 per cent as provided under
Section 112
, Sub-section (1) of the Act.
4. The assessee-company has furnished detailed particulars in the matter of computing the long-term capital gains. In the case of shares acquired between 1938 and 1968, CAD capital gains were computed under the first proviso to
Section 48
of the Act. Thus, in the case of shares acquired prior to 1-4-1981, the fair market value (FMV) of the shares as on 1-4-1981 was adopted by the assessee as the cost under
Section 55(2)(b)(i)
of the Act. The FMV was adopted on the prevailing Stock Exchange rate. The sale consideration pertaining to CAD shares were converted into CAD in pursuance of rule 115A of the Income-tax Rules, 1962. Capital gains were thus initially worked out in CAD and thereafter, reconverted into Indian rupees.
5. In respect of USD shares also conversion was made under rule 115A and thus capital gains were computed.
6. In the case of bonus shares, capital gains were computed in Indian rupees on the basis of cost of acquisition worked out on the basis of FMV as on 1-4-1981 in respect of shares allotted before 1-4-1981. Cost of acquisition was taken at nil in respect of bonus shares allotted after 1-4-1981 in terms of
Section 55(2)(aa)(iiia)
.
7. While assessing capital gains, the assessing officer held that in the case of shares acquired by the assessee prior to 1-4-1981, the assessee could not take the benefit of FMV provided in
Section 55(2)(fe)(z)
, thereby, meaning that the assessee cannot substitute its cost with FMV as on 1-4-1981. This is because, according to the assessing authority, the assessee is nonresident and the non-residents are required to compute the capital gains in terms of the foreign currency conversion in terms of first proviso to
Section 48
. In other words, the assessing officer held that the capital gains in the case of assessee being a non-resident, has to be computed on conversion of the foreign currency and simultaneously the assessee could not avail the benefit of FMV as on 1-4-1981. The Commissioner (Appeals) concurred with the view of the assessing authority relying on the decision of ITAT, Mumbai, in the case of
Novartis AG Basle v. Asstt. CIT (IT Appeal No.
537 (Mum.) of 2002).
8. The above question is one of the points of dispute before us that, whether, the assessee-company can avail the option of substituting FMV as on 1-4-1981 as the cost of acquisition of shares acquired by it before 1-4-1981 in the light of
Section 55(2)(b)(i)
and, whether, the proviso to
Section 48
debars the assessee from opting the FMV for the reason that the said proviso directs the non-resident assessee to compute the capital gains on foreign currency conversion rule.
9. We heard Shri S.E. Dastur, the learned Sr. Advocate, appearing for the assessee; and Shri S.C. Gupta, learned Commissioner of Income-tax, appearing for the revenue.
10. While considering the above issue, we have to refer to the decision of of the Tribunal which held that the non-resident would not be entitled for benefit of
Section 55(2)
(&)(i) was taken in appeal before the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in Income-tax Appeal No. 788/2004. The said appeal has been heard and disposed off by Their Lordships through judgment dated 19-9-2006. The Hon'ble Bombay High Court observed therein that the Tribunal has accepted the contention of the revenue that a nonresident was not entitled to indexation under
Section 48
of the Act and, therefore, was not eligible to rely on
Section 55(2)(b)(i)
. In this respect, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court considered the following two questions :
(i) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal erred in holding that the assessee was not entitled to exercise the option under
Section 55(2)
(&)(i) of the Act to adopt the fair market value of shares as on 1-4-1981 as the cost of acquisition of such shares when computing the capital gain/loss arising on the transfer of the said shares ?
(ii) Whether the Tribunal erred in holding that the first proviso to
Section 48
of the Act was charging section and therefore erred in holding that
Section 55(2)(b)(i)
of the Act was not available to the assessee being a non-resident ?
11. On considering the above two questions, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court held that they direct the Tribunal to decide the liability of the appellant independent of
Section 48
of the Act. With the said direction, the case has been revived before the Tribunal.
12.
In the light of the above judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court, it is to be seen that the decision of the Tribunal, Mumbai, in the case of
Novartis AG Basle
(supra) does not hold good any more and consequently the substratum of the decision arrived at by the Commissioner (Appeals) has been vitiated.
Therefore, it is not permissible for us to rely on the decision of the Tribunal in the case of
Novartis AG Basle
, (supra) even though a fervent plea was made by the learned Commissioner of Income-tax that the findings of the Tribunal in
the said decision
have to be acted upon as they decided the matter in the right prospective.
13. We have to still remember that the direction of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court is to consider the issue independent of
Section 48
of the Act.
Section 55
deals with the meaning of the expression "adjusted", "cost of improvement and" cost of acquisition". These definitions have been made in
Section 55
for the purpose of
Sections 48
and
49
of the Act.
Section 48
p deals with the mode of computation and
Section 49
refers to cost with reference to certain modes of acquisition. Therefore, it is to be seen that these provisions are machinery provisions embedded in the provisions of statute relating to the assessment of capital gains meant for computing the capital gains under different circumstances. Therefore, at the first instance itself, we have to state that the
Sections 48
,
49
and
55
are not charging sections, as tried to explain by the lower authorities.
14.
Section 55(2)
deals with the cost of acquisition for the purpose of
Sections 48
and
49
. Clause (b) and Sub-clause (f) thereof deals with the capital asset which became the property of the assessee before 1-4-1981. In such cases, the law provides that the cost of acquisition of the asset can be taken as the FMV of the asset as on 1-4-1981 or at the actual cost incurred by the assessee, at the option of the assessee. This option is really given to an assessee to come out of an unfair situation. That is, in respect of assets acquired in the old past, if a reasonable value is not assigned to it as cost of acquisition, the cost would be always the historical cost for which the assets were acquired, which would be having no relevance at all in a contemporary computation of capital gains. Therefore, to bring out such assets acquired long back in the past, the law has provided the assessee to opt for the FMV as on 1 -4-1981 if it is beneficial to it so that the said value would be more reasonable and realistic. This option is an independent provision provided by the statute in
Section 55
. It is independent of
Section 48
.
Section 48
deals with mode of computation.
Section 55
deals with the meaning of cost of acquisition which is only one limb in the computation. The difference is obvious. It is only after working out the cost of acquisition within the meaning of
Section 55
that the capital gains could be computed under
Section 48
. That must be the reason why the Hon'ble Bombay High Court has directed the Tribunal to consider the issue independent of
Section 48
while disposing the matter in the case of the
Novartis AG Baste
(supra).
15. First proviso to
Section 48
permits a non-resident to compute the capital gains after converting the concerned variables into the foreign currency in which the shares were first acquired. This facility of conver sion is provided for the reason that the conversion rate difference between Indian currency and foreign currency is different from currency to currency and fluctuate from time to time and not stable and also not comparable. Therefore, if no conversion is made and the capital gains is computed in Indian currency, the computation will not reflect the " real capital gains". If the facility of currency conversion is not available and if the capital gains are computed throughout in Indian currency, the computation would be distorted and unrealistic. It is a rule of income taxation that what is to be taxed is real income. For that matter, capital gains is also treated as income. Accordingly, it is necessary that what is assessed is real capital gains. It is for that purpose proviso to
Section 48
is provided in that section. The said proviso does not restrict or undo the option available to an assessee under
Section 55
(2 )(>)(). They are operating in two different realms.
16. Not only that, the plain reading of the language of the provision contained in
Section 55
, nowhere make the said
Section 55
subservient to
Section 48
. In fact,
Section 55
defines the value of the variables necessary for competing the capital gains as provided in
Section 48
.
17. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we find that the assessee is entitled to for the benefit of the option available under
Section 55(2)
( b)( i) of the Act. Therefore, the assessing authority is directed to compute the capital gains attributable to the shares acquired by the assessee-company before 1-4-1981, after giving the benefit of FMV as on 1-4-1981.
18. This issue is decided in favour of the assessee.
19. The assessing officer has further determined the capital gains tax at the rate of 20 per cent whereas, the assessee claimed the rate of 10 per cent under
Section 112(1)
of the Act. The Commissioner (Appeals) also has held that the rate of tax should be 20 per cent. The Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) in the case of In re University Superannuation Scheme Ltd. (2005) 275 ITR 434,' has considered and held in favour of the assessee in stating that the assessee is entitled to concessional rate of tax at 10 per cent. Therefore, this issue is also decided in favour of the assessee and direct the assessing authority to levy tax at the rate: of 10 per cent.
20. The next issue to be considered in this appeal is regarding the cost of acquisition of bonus shares allotted to assessee prior to 1 -4-1981. This issue was considered by ITAT, Mumbai, in the case of
Heinrich De Fries GMBH v. Joint CIT
. The Tribunal has held that in the case of bonus shares issued prior to 1-4-1981, the assessee has the option to take the cost of acquisition at the FMV as on 1-4-1981. This decision has been taken by the Tribunal in the light of the
Section 55(2)(aa)(iiia)
. Following
the above decision
, we hold that in the case of bonus shares acquired by the assessee prior to 1-4-1981, the assessee's contention for adopting the FMV as on 1-4-1981 as the cost of acquisition should be accepted. We D direct the assessing authority accordingly.
21. In the case of bonus shares acquired after 1-4-1981, the cost of acquisition shall be nil
22. The appeal filed by the assessee is allowed to the above extent.
23. Next we will consider the appeal filed by the revenue.
24. The only ground raised by the revenue is that, the Commissioner (Appeals) has erred in E holding that the assessee is not liable to interest under
Section 324B
of the Act as the income was liable to deduction of tax at source.
25. As the dispute relating to the computation of capital gains has been decided by us on merit, we find that this ground raised by the revenue has become infructuous.
26. In the result, appeal filed by the assesses is allowed and the appeal filed by the revenue is dismissed.

Delhi High Court
Roshan Lal vs State on 30 January, 1992
Equivalent citations: 1992(46)DRJ554
JUDGMENT  

 V.B. Banaal, J.
(1) His order is to dispose of an application moved by Roshan Lal Petitioner for bail for the offences under Section 302/397/3 read with Sec 34TPC. Police Station Nangloi.
(2) Briefly slated the case of the prosecution has been that Lala Harkishan Dass complainant has been carrying on business at Nangloi though he has been a resident of Bahadurgarh. S/Shri Sham Sunder, Hans Raj, Raju and Krishan sons of Mohan Lal have been working as property dealers at Bahadurgarh. Some time before 4th March, 1991 they got a deal settled in respect of a property of Suresh Singhal r/o 34/56, West Punjabi Bagh in favor of Tilak Raj, Tarsem and Sarover r/o Gurdaspur, Some differences, however, arose between them in respect of the aforesaid deal. In these circumstances, Suresh Singhal and Sham Sunder and others made a request to Lala Harkishan Dass to get their disputes settled and with this aim both the parties agreed to come to the office of the complainant Lala Harkishan Dass at about 4 00 P.M. on 4th March, 1991.
(3) On the aforesaid date Sham Sunder along with his brothers Raju, Hans Raj and Krishan reached the office of Lala Harkishan Dass at about 4.00 P.M. where Tilak Raj, Tarsem and Sarover were also present. Suresh singhal and his father Pritpal while accompanied by another person reached the said office at about 5.10 P.M. and immediately thereafter hot words were exchanged between Sham Sunder and Suresh Singhal. At that time Suresh Singhal took out a revolver from his pocket and fired at Sham Sunder. There was commotion in the office and Harkishan Dass along with others came out from the back door of the said premises Lala Harkishan Dass subsequently came to know about the death of Sham Sunder and about the Injuries of others. Suresh Singhal, his father and their companion left behind their Maruti Car DL-4C-0532 and escaped in a Fiat Car of one Subhash which was parked at the spot.
(4) Krishan and Hans Raj brothers of Sham Sunder also sustained injuries in this incident. Krishan was declared dead when taken to the hospital while Hans Raj survived, though he had also received bullet injuries.
(5) Prosecution placed reliance upon the statements of Hans Raj injured, Raj Kumar both brothers of the deceased besides the statement of the complainant Lala Harkishan Dass and the statements of Tilak Raj, Tarsem and Sarover. During the recording of the statements of the eye witnesses it was found that the petitioner was the third companion of Suresh Singhal and 556 Pritpal Singhal and that at the instance of Suresh Singhal the petitioner had gone to the Maruti Car to bring the rifle from there.
(6) Learned Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner was not named by eye witness of this incident and that no role has been attributed to Roshan Lal. He has also submitted that in the Fir there has not been any mention of the petitioner having been asked to bring a gun from the Maruti Car. He has also submitted that the petitioner is not in any way connected with Suresh Singhal and his father and so prayer has been made for his release on bail.
(7) Application has been opposed by learned Counsel for the respondent who has submitted that the petitioner shared common intention with Suresh Singhal and Pritpal Singhal which is apparent from the facts that immediately after reaching the premises of Lala Harkishan Dass Suresh Singhal picked up a quarrel and immediately fired at Sham Sunder. He has also submitted that the common intention of the petitioner shared with the co-accused is apparent from the fact that be had gone to the Maruti Car to bring the gun from there and the only purpose of asking for the gun was to fire at the persons who started running from the office of the complainant. He has also submitted that the petitioner ran away from the spot along with his co-accused and he was arrested at the Igi Airport along with Pritpal Singhal. He has also submitted that in this incident two brothers lost their lives and Hans Raj has escaped death because of timely medical aid though every attempt was made to liquidate him also by causing three bullets injuries to him.
(8) I have given my thoughtful consideration to all these submissions and have also gone through the statements of the witnesses as also the M.L Cs. There is no doubt that there is no mention of the role of the petitioner in the statement of the complainant but it stands explained as the complainant has stated that he came out of the office from the back door when the incident was going on and, thus, it cannot be said that there is any improvement in the subsequent statements. Hans Raj was examined on 9th March, 1991 after he was declared fit for making statement and he has made a categorical statement about the role of the petitioner. It has also been stated by Raj Kumar that on 3rd March, 1991 he along with his brother Sham Sunder had gone to the house of Suresh Singhal and Pritpal Singhal and that some hot words were exchanged at that lime between Sham Sunder on one side and Suresh Singhal and his father on the other side.
(9) There is no doubt that the petitioner is not named in the FIR. He has, however, been arrested on 14th March, 1991 with Pritpal Singhal and was produced in Court with muffled face when he declined to participate in the test identification parade. Supplementary statements of witnesses have thereafter been recorded who have stated that the petitioner was the third companion of Suresh Singhal and Pritpal Singhal. The question as to how far these witnesses are reliable will have to be gone into during trial.
(10) . Considering all these facts but without expressing any opinion about the allegations, I am clearly of the view that no case is made out for the release of the petitioner on bail. I may make it clear that any observation made in this order will have no bearing on the final decision of the case which shall be decided on the basis of the evidence which may be produced.
(11) As a result, the application stands dismissed.

 Proceedings
The Commissioner asked whether the information was provided to the Appellant.
The appellant pointed out that whereas information had been given to him about the
status of this complaint after the RTI application, the respondents had not given the
information about the action taken on his complaints from the date that the filed the
complaints, up to the date the RTI application. The respondents said that they had
understood that they needed to provide this information only after the date of the filing of
the RTI application. They have been directed to furnish this information to the appellant
by 6, November 2008 for the action taken on the complaints from the date that the
complaints of filed.
On the question of imposing penalties on the responsible officers they claim that the RTI
application had initially been handled by one person and from there it went to 3 different
departments and the various officers have handled the application, and therefore it was
difficult for them to identify the responsible officers. The commission has asked them to
prepare a table listing the movement of the RTI application and the names and
designations of the officers who had handled the RTI application. They were directed to
deliver this by 06/11/2008 after which the commission will decide on the further action to
be taken.

Andhra HC (Pre-Telangana)

Equivalent citations: AIR2003AP486, 2004(1)ALT493, III(2004)BC145, AIR 2003 ANDHRA PRADESH 486, (2003) 2 ANDHWR 295, (2004) 3 BANKCAS 145, (2004) 1 ANDH LT 493, (2004) 2 BANKCLR 718
ORDER
 

C.V. Ramulu, J.
1. This Civil Revision Petition is directed against an Order elated 6-9-2001 passed in I.A. No. 1174 of 1999 in O.S. No. 34 of 1999 on the file of the Court of Principal Senior Civil Judge at Warangal.
2. The said application filed under
Order XXII, Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure
to set aside the abatement of the suit against the 1st defendant was dismissed as barred by limitation along with I.A. No. 38 of 2000, which was filed for impleading the legal representatives of the deceased 1st defendant. The petitioner herein-Nethra Chits (P) Limited is the plaintiff and applicant in the above suit and interlocutory Applications respectively. He laid the suit for recovery of certain money against defendants 1 to 4. The notice sent to the 1st defendant-B. Ramachandra Reddy was returned unserved on 26-3-1999 with an endorsement that the party died. However, appearance was filed on behalf of defendants 2 to 4 and the case was posted for taking steps for adding legal representatives of the deceased-1st defendant and for filing the written statement of defendants 2 to 4. Thereafter, defendants 2 to 4 filed their written statement.
3. In the affidavit filed in support of I.A. No. 1174 of 1999, the petitioner-plaintiff had stated that he had filed the suit for recovery of money against the respondents/defendants and on 25-6-1999 when the suit was posted for written statement of defendants 2 to 4, it was learnt that summons sent to defendant No. 1 were returned on the ground that he died on 5-5-1998 leaving behind him, his widow, two sons and a daughter. Thus, he came to know about the death of the 1st defendant only on 25-6-1999 and as such, prayed for setting aside the abatement against the 1st defendant and also to implead the legal representatives of the deceased 1st defendant whose description is given in the petition as defendants 5 to 8 in the suit, in the interests of justice. Except this, no other reason was furnished.
4. A counter-affidavit has been filed on behalf of the proposed respondents wherein it was stated that the suit was filed on 1-12-1998 and the petitioner-plaintiff failed to file the application within 60 days from the date of abatement as per
Article 121
of the
Limitation Act, 1963
. The admitted facts disentitle the petitioner-plaintiff to seek the relief of setting aside the abatement of the suit, without the petition for condonation of delay. The same counter is also filed in I.A. No. 38 of 2000. Thus, both the I.As. were disposed of by a common order.
5. It was noticed by the Court below that the 1st defendant died on 5-5-1998 much before the filing of the suit on 15-2-1999. Thus, the suit itself was laid against a dead person. The summons were returned on 26-3-1999 stating that the 1st defendant died. Thereafter, the suit was posted for taking steps for adding the legal representatives of the 1st defendant. The petitioner filed the I.As. on 14-10-1999 stating that there is no delay in filing the petitions, as it came to know the death of the 1st defendant only on 25-6-1999 and as such, the petitions are within limitation. However, the Office of the lower Court had returned the said I.As. for filing a petition under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act, 1963. The same was represented by the petitioner stating that as per the
Limitation Act, 1963
, the petitions are within time; hence, the petition under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act is not necessary. After examining Order XXII, Rules 4 and 9
of CPC
, the Court below held that the petitioner failed to file the petition to set aside abatement within 150 days of the death of the 1st defendant and had also not filed the petition under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act and, therefore, dismissed the applications as barred by limitation. Aggrieved by the said order, the present Civil Revision Petition is filed.
6. For proper appreciation of the controversy involved in this lis, it is necessary to examine the provisions under which the said applications are filed i.e. Rules 4 and 9 of
Order XXII of CPC
, which read as follows :
"Rule 4. Procedure in case of death of one of several defendants or of sole defendant:--(1) Where one of two or more defendants dies and the right to sue does not survive against the surviving defendant or defendants alone, or a sole defendant or sole surviving defendant dies and the right to sue survives, the Court, on an application made in that behalf, shall cause the legal representative of the deceased defendant to be made a party and shall proceed with the suit.
(2) Any person so made a parry may make any defence appropriate to his character as legal representative of the deceased defendant.
(3) Where within the time limited by law no application is made under Sub-rule (1), the suit shall abate as against the deceased-defendant.
(4) The Court whenever it thinks fit, may exempt the plaintiff from the necessity of substituting the legal representatives of any such defendant who has failed to file a written statement or who, having filed it, has failed to appear and contest the suit at the hearing; and judgment may, in such case, be pronounced against the said defendant notwithstanding the death of such defendant and shall have the same force and effect as if it has been pronounced before death took place.
(5) Where,--
(a) the plaintiff was ignorant of the death of a defendant, and could not, for that reason, make an application for the substitution of the legal representative of the defendant under this rule within the period specified in the Limitation Act, 1963, and the suit has, in consequence, abated, and
(b) the plaintiff applies after the expiry of the period specified therefor in the
Limitation Act, 1963
, for setting aside the abatement and also for the admission of that application under
Section 5
of the Act on the ground that he had, by reason of such ignorance, sufficient cause for not making the application within the period specified in the said Act,  
 

 the Court shall, in considering the application under the said
Section 5
, have due regard to the fact of such ignorance, if proved.
Rule 9. Effect, of abatement or dismissal,--(1) Where a suit abates or is dismissed under this Order, no fresh suit shall be brought on the same cause of action.
(2) The plaintiff or the person claiming to be the legal representative of a deceased plaintiff or the assignee or the receiver in the case of an insolvent plaintiff may apply for an order to set aside the abatement or dismissal; and if it is proved that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from continuing the suit, the Court shall set aside the abatement or dismissal upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit.
(3) The provisions of Section 5 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1877 (XV of 1877), shall apply to application under Sub-rule (2). (Explanation.-- Nothing in this rule shall be construed as barring, in any later suit, a defence based on the facts which constituted the cause of action in the suit which had abated or had been dismissed under this Order.)"

Limitation Act
, the suit stands abated. The said Rule also states that if the plaintiff applies for setting aside the abatement after expiry of the period of limitation, he has to file an application under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act on the ground that he had, by reason of ignorance, could not make the application within time and the Court shall, in consideration of such application, have due regard to the fact of such ignorance, if proved.
Article 120
of the
Limitation Act, 1963
stipulates that an application to have the legal representative of a deceased plaintiff or appellant or defendant or respondent shall be filed within ninety (90) days from the date of death of the said party. As already stated above, if an application to being the legal representatives of a deceased party is not filed within the period stipulated, the suit stands abated as against the party who died as per Rule 4(3) of
Order XXII of CPC
. Under
Article 121
of the
Limitation Act
, an application to set aside the order of abatement shall be filed within sixty days from the date of abatement.
9. In the instant case, the fact that the 1st defendant died on 5-5-1998 came to light when the summons sent to him were returned on 26-3-1999, Therefore, the application for setting aside the abatement has to be filed by the petitioner within 150 (90 + 60) days of the date of death of the 1st defendant, as per the said
Articles 120
and
121
of the
Limitation Act
. As the petitioner failed to file the applications within the above stipulated time and without the petition under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act, though insisted to be filed by the Office of the lower Court, the Court below rejected the petitions as barred by limitation.
10. Admittedly, in the case on hand, even after the return of the petitions asking the petitioner-plaintiff to file an application under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act, the same was represented without making any application as required under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act. On the other hand, it was submitted that there was no necessity to file such an application. A bare look at Clause (5) of Order XXII, Rule 4,
CPC
makes it clear that the application under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act is necessary even if there is ignorance and it is a sufficient cause for condoning the delay. But, filing of an application under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act is mandatory and thereafter, the Court will examine whether the cause shown for the delay is sufficient or not. Under those circumstances, the Court below has rightly observed that under
Order XXII, Rule 4 of CPC
the petitioner-plaintiff may apply for setting aside the abatement order within the period of limitation and if the period of limitation is over, he can even file an application under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act for condoning the delay.
11. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner came to know about the death of the 1st defendant only on 25-6-1999 and. therefore, the petition filed by the revision petitioner to set aside the abatement is not barred by limitation and the limitation can only he taken from the date of knowledge.
In support of his contention, he relied upon a judgment of this Court reported in
R. Rajyalakshmamma v. R. Kannaiah
,  and submits that a suit against a person dead at the time of its institution is not void ab initio and the legal representatives can be impleaded even after the expiry of the period of limitation, if the omission to implead them was due to bona fide mistake. Absolutely, there is no dispute about the proposition
laid down in
the said decision
. But, in the instant case, there is a delay in filing the petition to implead the legal representatives and though the Court below insisted for filing of an application under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act, the petitioner did not even file the same. On the other hand, the petitioner stated that there was no necessity for filing such application.
12. The counsel for the petitioner also relies upon a judgment of the Apex Court reported in
Karuppaswamy v. C. Ramamurthy
.
wherein
the said decision
of this Court in
Rajyalakshmamma
's case (supra) was considered. It was observed that normally, if the plaintiff had known about the death of defendant, he would have filed the suit in the first instance against his heirs and legal representatives and that the High Court too recorded a finding that there was nothing to show that the plaintiff was aware of the death of the defendant and yet knowing well about it, he would persist in filing the suit against a dead person and held that since the plaintiff had taken prompt action and had acted in good faith, the Proviso to
Section 21(1)
of the Limitation Act could be invoked in his favour and the legal representatives of the deceased defendant could be impleaded, Here also, there is no dispute about the
ratio
laid down in
the said case.
13. In both the said cases, the defendant died just before the institution of the very suit and steps were taken for bringing the legal representatives on record as required under Order XXII, Rule 4,
CPC
within the period of limitation. However, in those cases there was no adjudication as to what would happen if the petitions for impleadment of legal representatives and set aside the abatement was filed beyond the period of limitation fixed under the
Limitation Act, 1963
.
14. In the instant case, the main question is whether the applications to bring the legal representatives on record and to set aside the abatement have to be accompanied by a petition under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act when they are filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed under
Articles 120
and
121
of the
Limitation Act
?
15.
Article 120
of the
Limitation Act
stipulates that the application to have the legal representative of a deceased plaintiff or appellant or defendant or respondent has to be filed within ninety days of the date of death of the said party. It is not in dispute, in the instant case that the suit was instituted on 15-2-1999 and the summons were returned against the 1st defendant with an endorsement that, the person died and even according to the petitioner the summons were returned on 26-3-1999, but the application for bringing the legal representatives on record was filed on 14-10-1999 on the ground that he came to know about the death of the 1st defendant on 25-6-1999 when the suit was posted for written statement of defendants 2 to 4. In spite of there being a specific provision in
the CPC
as noted above and even after the Court below insisted upon filing of such application, the petitioner has not availed the opportunity. The date when the petitioner-plaintiff gets the knowledge about the death of the 1st defendant is irrelevant under
Article 120
read with
Order XXII, Rule 4 of CPC
. As, in the instant case, the application to bring the legal representatives on record was not filed within the above stipulated time of 90 days, the suit as against the deceased 1st defendant automatically abated, as per Sub-rule (3) of Rule 4 of
Order XXII of the Code of Civil Procedure
, 1908. In this connection, it is relevant to refer the decision in Jatav Panchayat Committee v. VII Addl. District Judge, Etawah, AIR 2000 All 253, wherein it was held (para 7) ;
"An application made after 90 days from the date of death, is an application for substitution upon setting aside abatement. The prayer for abatement being made within the period of limitation the substitution would be made only after setting aside the abatement and, therefore, no application explaining the delay would be necessary, if such application is made with a prayer for setting aside abatement within 150 days from the date of death. But at the same time, the said application cannot be maintained without the prayer for setting aside abatement. if such application for setting aside abatement is made after 150 days, in that event, definitely an application under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act, would be necessary.........."
16. From the above discussion, this Court is of the view that the limitation for a petition to bring the legal representatives of a deceased party on record runs from the date of death of such party. However, if a petition to bring the legal representatives on record is not filed within a period of 90 days as prescribed under
Article 120
of the
Limitation Act
, the suit stands abated automatically as against, the deceased defendant. Thereafter, the plaintiff has to file the application for setting aside the abatement within 60 days from the date of abatement, as per
Article 121
of the
Limitation Act
. If the applications for abatement and to implead the legal representatives are filed thereafter, i.e. after 150 days (90 + 60), the plaintiff can very well file a petition under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act and plead for the ignorance of the fact of death of the defendant. The Court may examine the merits of that petition and may condone the delay in filing the petitions for abatement and impleadment and then proceed with the suit. But, if no petition for condoning the delay as required under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act is filed, the Court can very well reject the applications for abatement and impleadment. In fact, it is not the date of knowledge that is important, it is the date of death of a party, which is, important and from that date the limitation runs. In the case on hand, it is for the petitioner to prove that he was ignorant and came to know of the death of the 1st defendant only on 25-6-1999 and pray the Court to condone the delay. But, without there being a petition under
Section 5
of the Limitation Act, the abatement cannot be set aside and the legal representatives of the deceased party cannot be brought on record. This view of mine is fortified by the following decisions :
(i) Punjab State v. Kabul Singh,  and
(ii) S.R. Gaitonde v. J.J. Fonseca, AIR 1976 Goa 11.
17. For the aforesaid reasons, the findings of the Court below cannot be faulted. The applications filed by the petitioner were rightly rejected by the trial Court. Absolutely, there are no grounds to interfere with the order passed by the lower Court.
18. The Civil Revision Petition fails and is accordingly dismissed. No order as to costs.

Allahabad High Court
Panchhi Petha Stores vs The Commissioner Sales Tax on 26 April, 2007
Author:
Ashok Bhushan
Bench:
Ashok Bhushan
JUDGMENT
 

Ashok Bhushan, J.
1. Heard Sri Subham Agarwal holding brief of Sri Piyus Agarwal, learned Counsel for the revisionist and Sri U.K. Pandey, learned Counsel appearing for the respondents.
2. Both the above revisions involve similar question of law and facts, hence the same are being decided by this common judgment. The facts of Revision No. 965 of 1991 is being noted for deciding both the revisions.
3. This revision has been filed under
Section 11
of the UP. Sales Tax Act against the order dated 22th April, 1991 by which order two appeals filed by the revisionist relating to the assessment year 1982-83 and 1983-84 have been dismissed.
4. Brief facts necessary for deciding the controversy raised in this revision are; assessment orders with regard to years in question were passed on 25th May, 1984 and 28th January, 1984. After passing of the assessment order, the assessing authority came to know about the statement made by Kanhaiya Lal, the partner of the firm on 24th February, 1987 at the time of income tax search under
Section 132
of the Income Tax Act. In the said statement Kanhaiya Lal stated that daily sale was between Rs. 30007- to 4,500/-. of the firm in the relevant years. After being satisfied certain tax has escaped assessment, proceeding under Section 21 of the Trade Tax Act were initiated by the assessing authority. An order was passed of reassessment under Section 21 of the U.P. Trade Tax Act on 16th September, 1987 reassessing the tax liability. Consequently, demand was issued accordingly. Appeals were filed by the assessee against the reassessment order, which appeals were allowed and the matter was remanded to the assessing authority for reassessment. Against the order passed by first appellate authority dated 1.1.1988, second appeals were filed by the revisionist before the Trade Tax Tribunal. Both the appeals were dismissed by the Trade Tax Tribunal vide order dated 22nd April, 1991 against which order the present revision has been filed.
5. Learned Counsel for the revisionist contended that proceedings under
Section 21
could not have been initiated on the basis of statement of a partner recorded on 24th February, 1987. He further submits that the income tax appellate tribunal itself has passed an order on 9th February, 1999 in which the said statement of parter was held to be made at the time when Kanhaiya Lal was suffering from various diseases and was not well. He submits that very basis on which reassessment has been started having gone, there is no occasion for opening the reassessment proceeding. He submitted that the basis on which the assessing authority had reason to believe that any pan of turnover has escaped assessment having knocked out, the said proceedings are liable to be dropped. He has placed reliance on a judgment of this Court reported in 2006 U.P. Tax Cases 67;
Kothari Product Ltd., Kanpur v. Commissioner of Sales Tax and another
judgment of this Court reported in 2006 National Tax News Views (Vo.9) 38; Orient Ceramics and Industries Limited, Bulandshahr v. Commissioner, Sales Tax, U.P. Lucknow.
6. Sri U.K. Pandey. appearing for the respondents, submitted that there is sufficient reason to belives for initiating proceedings under
Section 21
. He submits that statement was made by the partner Kanhaiya Lal. In the income tax proceedings and making of statement has not been denied at any stage. He submitted that even the order of income tax appellate tribunal on which reliance is being placed by the revisionist itself upheld the reassessment proceedings, hence there is no error in starting proceedings under
Section 21
. The first appellate authority and appellate tribunal have rightly passed the orders and there is no merit in the revision.
7. I have considered the submissions of counsel for the parties and perused the record.
8.
Section 21(1)
provides that if the assessing authority has reason to believe that whole or part of the turnover of a dealer had escaped assessment to tax, the assessing authority may after issuing notice to dealer assess or re-assess the dealer. Section 21(1) of the U.P. Trade Tax Act. 1948 is quoted below:
21. Assessment of tax on the turnover not assessed during the year.-(1) If the Assessing Authority has reason to believe that the whole of any part of the turnover of a dealer, from any assessment year or part thereof, had escaped assessment to tax or has been under-assessed or has been assessed to lax at a rate lower than that at which it is assessable under this Act, or any deductions or exemptions has been wrongly allowed in respect thereof, the Assessing Authority may, after issuing notice to the dealer and making such inquiry, as it may consider necessary, assess or reassess the dealer to tax according to law.
9. For initiating the reassessment proceedings under
Section 21(1)
the condition precedent is satisfaction of the authority that any part of turnover has escaped assessment the words used in Sub-section (1) of
Section 21
are ''reason to believe" The subjective satisfaction of the assessing authority has to be arrived on consideration of objective materials. In the present case parties are not at disagreement that statement was made by Kanhaiya Lal before the income tax authority on 24th February, 1987 in which he mentioned his turnover which covers the assessment year in question also. The statement given by the partner of the firm furnished a valid ground for assessing authority for starting reassessment proceedings.
10. The next submission of counsel for the revisionist is that income tax appellate authority having found that the said statement was made by Kanhaiya Lal when he was suffering from various diseases and was not well. The first appellate authority has remanded to the assessing authority for reassessment it is for the assessing authority to examine as to what value and credence be given to the statement when reassessment order is passed. Any observation made by the income tax appellate tribunal with regard to worth and credence of the statement can have no effect on initiation of proceeding for reassessment, which was made at the time when above appeals have not even come into existence. The submission of Sri U.K. Pandey that even the income tax appellate authority has upheld the reassessment order is also fully corroborated from the order itself. The income tax appellate tribunal made following observations in paragraph 5:
5.... During the course of search Kanhiyalal partner admitted having concealed the income to the extent of Rs. 35,000/- in each assessment year involved and also offered to pay tax thereon. The other material found during the course of search also suggested suppression of sales. The confession made by Kanhiyalal partner and other incriminating material found fully justified the Assessing Officer to entertain a reasonable belief for reopening the assessment within the meaning of
Section 147
of the Income-tax Act. We have also perused the copies of notices issued Under
Section 148
as placed in the first paper book of each year and in our view non-striking of the irrelevant portion thereof does not make the notices vague and illegal. The Assessing Officer has also recorded detailed reasons for the reopening of each of the assessment as per requirement of Sub-section (2) of
Section 148
of the Income-tax Act. We also find (hat the case laws relied upon by the learned Counsel are distinguishable on facts. On these facts we are of the considered view that the action taken by the Assessing Officer in reopening the assessments for the assessment years 1982-83 to 1986-97 is justified and valid
11.
In
Kothari Product
's case (supra), as relied by the counsel for the revisionist, the account books of the assessee were rejected by the assessing officer on the basis of information received from the Central Excise authorities, who surveyed the business premises of the assessee. Subsequently, the order passed by the appellate tribunal: was brought before the High Court by means of supplementary affidavit. In the said case noticing the order of the appellate tribunal this Court restored back to the tribunal the appeals for deciding afresh in accordance with the subsequent developments. The above case was not a case of reassessment and no such ratio has been
laid down in
the, said judgment
, which may help the revisionist in the present case.
Another judgment relied by counsel for the revisionist in M/s Orient Ceramics' (supra) was also a case where the matter was remanded back to the assessing authority to pass order afresh after taking in to account various orders passed by Central Excise authority. The said was also not a case of reassessment nor any ratio has been laid down, which may help the revisionist in the present case.
12. In view of the above, I do not find any error in the reassessment proceedings initiated by the assessing authority. The first appellate authority and the appellate tribunal both have rightly passed the orders which do not warrant any interference by this Court under its revisional jurisdiction.
13. Both the revision is dismissed. Parties shall bear their own costs.

ORAL
ORDER
1.		The
petitioners are shown as accused in an M. Case No.18/10, registered
at Bhanvad Police Station, pursuant to an order dated 21.07.2010,
passed by the concerned Magistrate, directing the registration of
such an FIR and calling for a report, within a period of 30 days.
2.		The
grievance of the petitioners is that they are falsely involved and
that they are completely un-related to the incident and are distant
relatives, who have been falsely roped in.
3.		At
this stage, since the investigation is, still, going on, it is not
appropriate to comment on the contentions of the petitioners. 
However, needless to say that the Investigating Officer shall not
cause arrest of the petitioners at random, without there being, at
lest, some prima
facie
material for suspecting that they have committed the offences in
question.
4.		With the
above observations, this petition is disposed of, at this stage.

ORAL
ORDER
(Per
: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE AKIL KURESHI)
 

 


 
	  

Revenue
	is in appeal against judgement of the Tribunal dated 11.8.2010
	raising following questions for our consideration :
Whether
	the Appellate Tribunal is right in law and on facts in canceling the
	penalty of Rs.6,56,990/- levied u/s.271(1)(c) of the Act?
Issue
	pertains to penalty levied by the Assessing Officer under
Section
	271(1)(c)
of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Assessee
	filed income of returns. While processing such returns, the
	Assessing Officer found that assessee's claim for exemption under
Section 10A
of the Act was not justified since the assessee did not
	export any article or thing. There were certain other disallowances
	also made by the Assessing Officer. On this ground, penalty
	proceedings were initiated. Ultimately, the Assessing Officer
	imposed penalty of Rs.6,56,000/- under
Section 271(1)(c)
of the Act.
The
	assessee carried the issue in appeal before the CIT(Appeals) . With
	respect to claim under
Section 10A
of the Act, assessee contended
	that its unit was located in Kandla Special Economic Zone (SEZ for
	short). As per EXIM policy of Government of India, sales made by the
	assessee to other units located in the said area were treated to be
	deemed export. On that basis assessee had made claim for exemption
	under
Section 10A
of the Act. CIT(Appeals) however, was of the
	opinion that such export was wholly far-fetched. Provision under
Section 10A
requires actual exports and would not cover deemed
	exports. He was of the opinion that the concept of deemed export
	contained in EXIM policy cannot be imported for the purpose of
Section 10A
exemption which did not contain any such  concept.  He
	observed as under :
"(cg)	The
	appellant might have had its own understanding for claiming
	exemption in respect of deemed export. As per it, its unit was
	granted permission under EXIM policy. So, whatever sales it made to
	other unit in the same zone should be  taken as discharge of export
	obligation as per the policy. The term Export' was not defined in
	the
Income Tax Act
, but that does not mean that the appellant could
	import some definition which could suit its need.
The Income Tax Act
never stated in
Section 10A
by way of any explanation or  a proviso
	that an assessee could adopt the meaning of 'Export' as defined in
	the EXIM policy. That means, the appellant has got only one option,
	that is, to follow the true meaning conveyed in
Section 10A
of the
	Act.
Section 10A
stipulated certain condition as per which, an
	assessee could claim exemption under
Section 10A
. They were very
	clear and mandatory. The appellant cannot  introduce its own meaning
	for the word 'Export' and it cannot go to an extent of saying that
	the goods manufactured and sold by it and exported (not by
	appellant) by other inter-zone units should also be considered as
	'Exports' as though the appellant exported the material. On the top
	of it, the appellants claim that the money received in foreign
	exchange by the other units on the sales made of the goods
	manufactured and supplied by the appellants should also be
	considered as thought the appellant satisfied the conditions of
Section 10A
is not acceptable."
Resultantly,
	CIT(Appeals) dismissed the appeal. On further appeal by the
	assessee,  the Tribunal deleted the penalty holding that admittedly
	the assessee had not given any information in returns which was
	found to be inaccurate or incorrect. Assessee therefore, cannot be
	stated to have furnished inaccurate particulars. With respect to the
	Revenue's stand that assessee had raised an incorrect claim, the
	Tribunal was of the opinion that assessee can be imposed to penalty
	only if case is strictly covered by provisions of
Section 271(1)(c)
.
	Tribunal observed that assessee had made claim for exemption under
Section 10A
with respect to certain amount with supporting documents
	produced on record. Such claim however, was not found allowable by
	the Assessing Officer. That by itself would not be sufficient to
	impose penalty. Tribunal noted that as per the policy of the
	Government, unit of the assessee  was situated in SEZ and assessee
	was not allowed to sell its product in local market but had to sell
	to other unit of SEZ who in turn exported the final product and
	earned foreign exchange on such exports. On  this basis, Tribunal
	deleted the penalty.
With
	respect to other ground of penalty, Tribunal found that Assessing
	Officer had only estimated gross profit by increasing the profit
	rate to 27% which was later on reduced by the CIT(Appeals) to 20%.
	On such estimation, penalty was not justified. We do not find any
	question of law arising. Tribunal found that assessee had not
	supplied any inaccurate particulars. Explanation of assessee for the
	claim made was reasonable. Assessee has based its claim for
	exemption under
Section 10A
on it being located in SEZ and its sale
	to other unit of SEZ being treated as deemed exports. The assessee
	had formed a bona fide belief that its claim was sustainable under
Section 10A
of the Act.
We
	see not reason to interfere. Appeal is therefore, dismissed.

Kureshi,J.)

Petitioner is a Motor Vehicle Inspector, who wanted to

get his date of birth corrected.    It is stated that he had

made Ext.P1 application on 28/11/1992, much before the

date of birth was corrected in the SSLC Book. It was only

by Ext.P7, that in 1997, correction in the SSLC Book was

carried out, pursuant to the orders that were passed in his

favour   by   the   Joint  Commissioner     for   Government

Examinations. Thereafter, the corrected SSLC Book was

produced to correct the date of birth in service records. This

was rejected by Exhibits P10, P12 and P14.
Admittedly, by the time he had applied with the

corrected SSLC Book in 1997, the time limit specified by the
WPC 26028/07
: 2 :
Government in GO(P) No.45/91/P&ARD dated 30.12.1991

had expired.   In view of this, no fault can be found in

Exhibits P10, P12 and P14 and this writ petition is only to be

dismissed and I do so.

Gujarat High Court
Shree Bansidhar Spinning And Weaving ... vs Income-Tax Officer, Companies ... on 11 January, 1980
Equivalent citations: (1980)16CTR(GUJ)16, [1980]125ITR537(GUJ)
JUDGMENT
DIVAN C.J. - The petitioner herein challenges the notices issued under
s. 148
of the I.T. Act, seeking to reopen the assessment for the assessment years 1965-66 to 1970-71. The relevant previous years for these assessment years are the calendar years 1964 to 1969, calendar year being the accounting year of the petitioner-company. The petitioner before us is a private limited company and carried on business of manufacturing textiles. The petitioner-company was registered on October 1, 1963, and came into being on that day. On October 3, 1963, the Petitioner-company purchased textile mills located at Ahmedabad for the aggregate sum of Rs.40,00,000 from Deepak Textile Industries Private Ltd. of Rajkot. The sale deed was executed in respect of lands, plant and part of machinery which was to be treated as immovable property because of the nature of that machinery and these immovable properties were taken to have been sold at the aggregate sum of Rs.4,00,000 by the vendor to the petitioner-company and the balance amount of Rs. 36,00,000 was treated as towards the rest of the machinery, furniture, etc., which were all treated as movables in which property passed on mere delivery of possession. There was no itemisation of the machinery in the sale deed but at the time of sale, the vendor furnished a list of the different machineries in this textile mill and the value allocated to the different items was shown in the list. In this list, there was one item showing as follows: "Electrification complete with transformers, switch gears, switches, starters and electric motors" and for all these items concerning electrical machinery a sum of Rs. 7,00,000 was shown in the list. The accounting year of the petitioner-company being the calendar year, for the period October 3, 1963, to December 31, 1963, income-tax return was filed for assessment year 1964-65 and along with the return filed, details were given regarding the machinery and also regarding the basis on which depreciation was being claimed by the petitioner-company. The petitioner-company claimed depreciation on the entire textile machinery worth Rs.36,00,000 less the amount of Rs.10,000 and the depreciation was claimed on the footing that the entire machinery worth Rs. 36,00,000 was textile machinery and the additional depreciation allowance permissible in the case of textile machinery was claimed by the petitioner-company. The petitioner-company also claimed extra shift allowance in respect of different shifts actually worked by the company. The ITO in the original assessment orders passed in 1964 and 1965 and also in each of the six successive years from the assessment year 1965-66 to 1970-71, accepted the figure furnished by the petitioner-company and passed order accordingly. In respect of the assessment year 1971-72, the ITO raised an objection regarding the claim of the petitioner-company to extra shift allowance because, according to the ITO, the extra shift allowance was not permissible on the entire amount of Rs. 7,00,000 which was for the electrification complete with transformers, switch gears, switches, starters and electric motors but was only climbable in respect of the lesser amount which was the cost of the electric motors only. According to the ITO, the electric motors were worth Rs. 2,49,100 and under the rules pertaining to the extra shift allowance, the extra shift allowance could be allowed only in relation to the cost of electric motors and not the cost of the entire electrification. Therefore, the extra shift allowance was not allowed in respect of the entire amount of Rs. 7,00,000 but was allowed only in respect of Rs. 2,49,100. Thereafter, on March 28, 1974, notices under
s. 148
were issued in respect of each of the six years which are under consideration before us in the present proceedings. It was clearly indicated that these notices were issued under
s. 147(a)
of the Act. In the courts of the correspondence which ensued, a letter was addressed by the ITO, the first respondent herein, on January 27, 1976, and in that letter the grounds for the notices for reopening the assessment for these six years under consideration were stated and the grounds as set out in that letter were two. It was pointed out by the first respondent that the assessment had been reopened under
s. 147(a)
of the Act on the ground that particulars regarding the claim of depreciation and extra shift allowance were not accurately furnished by the petitioner-company. The value of the total machinery of Rs. 35,90,000 included cost of electrical machinery shown in the list of plant and machinery as "Electrification complete with transformers switch gears, switches, starters and electric motors".
As per the Rules, extra shift allowance could not be allowed on the above electrical machinery except the electric motors which formed part of the textile machinery and, in the absence of any details regarding the cost of electric motors, the ITO proposed to estimate the same at Rs. 2,49,100 and also proposed to withdraw the extra shift allowance given of the petitioner-company on the balance of cost of electrical machinery of Rs.5,00,000. The second ground on which the reopening of the assessment was sought was that the petitioner-company had deducted the sale price of machineries from the written down value of machineries in two assessment years. In the assessment year 1966-67, the sale price of Rs. 1,32,135 was sought to be deducted and for the assessment year 1967-68, the sale price of Rs. 1,30,644 was sought to be deducted. The sale prices had been deducted from the written down value on the ground that separate prises for the items sold were not available. However, scrutiny revealed that the petitioner had sold seven Bowl Calendar Machines for Rs. 90,000. In the assessment year 1966-67, the cost of which was Rs. 70,000. In the same way, the petitioner-company had sold in the assessment year 1967-68, Singeing Machine for Rs. 1,12,200, the cost which was Rs. 84,000. Thus, there arose a capital gain as well as profit under
s. 41(2)
in the assessment years 1966-67 and 1967-68. The petitioner was, therefore, called upon to show cause why profit under
s. 41(2)
and capital gain should not be taxed in the assessment years 1966-67 and 1967-68 as mentioned in that letter. The ITO also stated that the written down value of the remaining machinery would increase for which the correct written down value would be taken while passing the assessment orders for the assessment years 1968-69 and onwards. Thus, as shown by this letter of January 27, 1976, proceedings were sought to be reopened on two grounds, one on the ground that extra shift allowance had been claimed and allowed in respect of all electrical machinery of Rs. 7,00,000, though in accordance with the Rules in that behalf it was permissible only in respect of electric motors valued at Rs. 2,49,100. The second ground on which the assessments were sought to be reopened, at least from assessment year 1968-69 onwards, were on the ground of sale price of the machinery having been shown and yet income under
s. 41(b)
, being balancing charge, being allowed and escaping assessment because cost price of this machinery was not disclosed in the relevant return. Consequently, not only deemed income by way of balancing charge under
s. 41(2)
had escaped assessment but also capital gains had escaped assessment and in the light of these factors the written down value for the assessment years 1968-69 onwards was required to be increased in the light of what was ordered in respect of assessment years 1966-67 and 1967-68.
In the petition the main ground of challenge is that all primary facts which the petitioner-company was required to disclose were in fact disclosed by the petitioner-company. Nothing was kept back and if because of some audit objection or audit note the ITO thought that he had made a mistake or that he had allowed extra shift allowance in a large amount by way of that allowance, then, the fault was of the ITO who passed the original assessment order and it was not because of any omission or failure on the part of the petitioner-company that extra shift allowance came to be granted in a larger amount.
Under
s. 147(a)
, if the ITO has reason to believe that, by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to make a return under
s. 139
for any assessment year to the ITO or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment for that year, he may, subject to the provisions of
ss. 148
to
153
, assess or reassess such income or recompute the loss or the depreciation allowance, as the case may be, for the assessment year concerned. All that we are required to find out as a condition precedent for the exercise of power under
s. 147(a)
in the instant case in whether there was any failure or omission on the part of the petitioner-company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment for the assessment years for which the assessment is sought to be reopened.
In the affidavit-in-reply filed by the first respondent it has been clearly stated in para. 6(d) that the petitioner-company claimed depreciation allowance including extra shift allowance on the written down value and submitted the statement showing the amount of depreciation claimed. The original orders of assessment for the relevant assessment years were made allowing the depreciation as claimed. But, according to the first respondent, the filing of the statement was not sufficient. The pointed attention of the ITO may not have been drawn and hence the claim was allowed. It was not shown that the depreciation statement was fully checked by the ITO concerned and after applying his mind the claim was allowed. In para. 6(e) of the affidavit-in-reply it has been stated that it was true that during the proceedings for the assessment year 1971-72, the ITO received an objection from the audit section of the I.T. department in respect of the extra shift allowance granted to the petitioner-company for the relevant assessment years. It was also true that for the assessment year 1971-72, the claim of the petitioner for extra shift allowance on the amount of Rs. 5,00,000 was disallowed. In para. 6(h) of the affidavit-in-reply it has been stated that in answer to a demand from the chartered accountant of the petitioner for being furnished with the reasons which formed the basis of the impugned notice, the petitioner was informed that the assessments were reopened under
s. 147(a)
of the Act, on the ground that particulars regarding the claim of depreciation (extra shift allowance) were not accurately furnished by the petitioner. It has been pointed out under para. 6(1) that capital gain as well as profit under
s. 41(2)
had escaped assessment so far as assessment years 1966-67 and 1967-68 were concerned and in that paragraph what has been stated in the letter of January 27 is reiterated. According to para. 6(1) of the affidavit-in-reply, it was submitted that the action of initiation of reassessment under
s. 147(a)
was perfectly legal, valid and binding on the petitioner. According to the first respondent, no doubt the attention of the ITO was drawn by an audit objection and that the reassessment was not pressed under
s. 147(b)
of the Act and it was contended that though there were different provisions for reopening the assessment under
ss. 147(a)
and
147(b)
, the scope was not mutually exclusive and it was contended that the revenue would be entitled to invoke either or both of the said provisions subject to the conditions laid down therein being satisfied. According to the first-respondent, per para. 6(1), the petitioner did not disclose true and full particulars of depreciation and though the statement was filed, the attention of the ITO was not drawn to the fact that electrical machinery was not eligible for depreciation except for electric motors. In para. 6(m) of the affidavit-in-reply it was contended that if the attention of the ITO was not drawn to the fact that electrical machinery did not qualify for allowance of depreciation (extra shift allowance), the action under
s. 147(a)
could be validly taken.
Thus, the affidavit-in-reply makes it clear that the proceedings were initiated after an audit objection by the audit section of the I.T. department and consequently the proceedings were sought to be taken under
s. 147(a)
because the pointed attention of the ITO was not drawn at the time of the original assessment to the fact that part of the electrical machinery only was confined to electrical motors and that the entire amount of Rs. 7,00,000 did not pertain to electric motors. It is to be borne in mind that in the original assessment orders for the relevant years, the ITO had noted that depreciation as per the statement was checked and that it was after going through the accounts and statements furnished by the assessee that the total income of the assessee was assessed and that shows that depreciation was checked and the same statement is to be found in the original assessment orders for each of the six orders under consideration before us. Hence, it is obvious that depreciation was being checked from the statements furnished by the assessee along with the return for each of the assessment years under consideration.
We may point out that in
Ahmedabad Cotton Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Union of India
[1974] 95 ITR 639 (Guj), the question of obligation of the ITO in connection with depreciation allowance was considered and relying on the observations of the Supreme Court in Maharana Mills (P.)
Ltd. v. ITO
[1959] 36 ITR 350, the observations being at page 357, it was held that the method enjoined for the purpose of ascertaining the written down value while granting depreciation allowance was that the ITO should take into consideration the actual cost determining it for himself, if necessary, taking into consideration the allowance granted in the past and then make his own computation as to the written down value for the assessment year with which he was concerned. Hence, it was obvious that if the ITO who passed the assessment order as in the case of the petitioner-company
in that case
at the time of the original assessments for the assessment years 1962-63 and 1963-64, had followed that method which was enjoined upon him and had taken into consideration the actual cost determining it for himself if necessary and had taken also into consideration the allowances granted in the past (inclusive of the initial allowance) and then had made his own computation as to the written down value for the assessment year with which he was concerned, it was obvious that no excess depreciation allowance would have been granted by him. Thus, even if the assessee furnishes his statement regarding depreciation, it is for the ITO concerned and that duty is enjoined upon him under the provisions of the Act, to work out the correct figure of depreciation for himself starting from the actual cost and, if necessary, work out the actual cost for himself and then working out the depreciation allowance granted in the past and then arrive at the computation for the depreciation allowance for the particular assessment year with which he was dealing at the moment. If he has not done so, then, he has to thank himself. If all the figures which would enable the ITO to arrive at the correct amount of depreciation have been furnished by the assessee, the rest has to be done by the ITO himself and to say that the pointed attention of the ITO at the time of the original assessment was not drawn to this or that particular feature is no ground for reopening the assessment.
In
Parashuram Pottery Works Co. Ltd. v. ITO
[1977] 106 ITR 1 (SC), the Supreme Court held that when an ITO relies upon his own records for determining the amount of depreciation allowance to the assessee and makes a mistake in doing so, responsibility for that mistake cannot be ascribed to an omission or failure on the part of the assessee and it was further held that where for certain items the ITO lost sight of the fact that the aggregate of the depreciation, including the initial depreciation allowed under the different heads, could not exceed the original cost to the assessee of those items of capital assets, the assessee could not be held responsible for the remissness on the part of the ITO in no applying the law contained in prov. (c) to s. 10(2)(vi) of the Indian I. T. Act, 1922, and it could not be said that excess depreciation, allowed because of the mistake in calculation of the depreciation, was allowed and income escaped assessment because of the assessees omission or failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts and no action can be taken for reopening the assessment under
s. 147(a)
of the I.T. Act, 1961, on the basis of the detection of that mistake alone after the expiry of four years from the end of the assessment year. At page 7 of the report, Khanna J., speaking for the Supreme Court, observed :
"Clause (a) of
section 147
of the Act of 1961 corresponds to clause (a) of sub-section (1) of
section 34
of the Act 1922. The language of clause (a) of
section 147
read with
sections 148
and
149
of the Act of 1961 as also the corresponding provisions of the Act of 1922 makes it plain that the two conditions have to be satisfied before the Income-tax Officer acquires jurisdiction to issue notice under
section 148
in respect of an assessment beyond the period of four years but within a period of eight years from the end of the relevant year, viz., (i) the Income-tax Officer must have reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment, and (ii) he must have reason to believe that such income has escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee (a) to make a return under
section 139
for the assessment year to the Income-tax Officer, or (b) to disclose fully and truly material facts necessary for his assessment for that year. Both these conditions must co-exist to confer jurisdiction on the Income-tax Officer. It is also imperative for the Income-tax Officer to record his reasons before initiating proceedings as required by
section 148 (2)
. Another requirement is that before notice is issued after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment years, the Commissioner should be satisfied on the reasons recorded by the Income-tax Officer that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice. The duty which is cast upon the assessee is to make a true and full disclosure of the primary facts at the time of the original assessment. Production before the Income-tax Officer of the account books or other evidence from which material evidence could with due diligence have been discovered by the Income-tax Officer will not necessarily amount to disclosure contemplated by law. The duty of the assessee in any case does not extend beyond making a true and full disclosure of primary facts. Once he has done that his duty ends. It is for the Income-tax Officer to draw the correct inference from the primary facts. It is no responsibility of the assessee to advise the Income-tax Officer with regard to the inference which he should draw from the primary facts."
and it was point out from the decision in
Calcutta Discount Co.s
case [1961] 41 ITR 191 (SC), that once all the primary facts were before the assessing authority, he required no further assistance by way of disclosure. It was for him to decide what inferences or facts could be reasonably drawn and what legal inferences have ultimately to be drawn. It was not for somebody else-far less the assessee-to tell the assessing authority what inferences, whether of facts or law, should be drawn. Indeed, when it is remembered that people often different as regards what inference should be drawn from given facts, it would be meaningless to demand that the assessee must disclose what inferences-whether of facts or law he should draw from the primary facts. At page 10, Khanna J. further observed :
"It has been said that the taxes are the price that we pay for civilization. It so, it is essential that those who are entrusted with the task of calculating and realising that price should familiarise themselves with the relevant provisions and become well-versed with the law on the subject. Any remissness on their part can only be at the cost of the national exchequer and must necessarily result in loss of revenue. At the same time, we have to bear in mind that the policy of law is that there must be a point of finality in all legal proceedings, that stale issues should not be reactivated beyond a particular stage and that laps of time must induce repose in and set at rest judicial and quasi-judicial controversies as it must in other spheres of human activity. So far as the income-tax assessment orders are concerned, they cannot be reopened on the score of income escaping assessment under
section 147
of the Act of 1961 after the expiry of four years from the end of the assessment year unless there be omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment."
In
Gemini Leather Stores v. ITO
[1975] 100 ITR 1, the Supreme Court has dealt with the problem of
s. 147(a)
and there the fact as were that in the proceedings for the original assessment of the appellant-firm, though the appellant did not disclose certain transactions evidenced by certain drafts, the officer himself discovered the facts relating thereto but by oversight did not bring the amounts represented by the drafts to tax as the income of the appellant. Subsequently, the ITO issued a notice under
s. 147(a)
of the I.T. Act, 1961, with a view to assess the amounts as the appellants income from undisclosed sources. On a writ petition filed by the appellant, the High Court held that the ITO did not apply his mind to the question whether the amounts could be treated as part of the total income of the appellant and as the appellant did not disclose the source of those amounts which were not recorded in the account books, all the conditions for invoking the jurisdiction under
s. 147(a)
were present. Reversing the decision of the High Court, the Supreme Court held that after discovery of the primary facts relating to the transactions evidenced by the drafts it was for the officer to make the necessary inquiries and draw proper inferences as to whether the amounts represented by the drafts could be treated as part of the total income of the appellant. That the officer did not do. It was plainly a case of oversight and it could not be said that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the appellant to disclose fully and truly all material facts. He could not, therefore, take recourse to
s. 147(a)
to remedy the error resulting from his own oversight.
In view of these two decisions of the Supreme Court in
Gemini Leather Stores
case [1975] 100 ITR 1 (SC) and the other in
Parashuram Pottery Works
case [1977] 106 ITR 1 (SC), it is clear that even if the extra shift allowance as part of depreciation allowance was wrongly allowed in the assessment years under consideration such extra shift allowance resulted from the omission on the part of the ITO himself to check correctly and interpret correctly the legal provisions and work out the correct figure of extra shift allowance permissible on the facts of this particular case. If any large amount had been allowed in the past, it was because of the mistake on the part of the ITO concerned, when he passed the original assessment orders. As the original assessment orders go to show, during each year it appears that the statement was checked and the amounts were discussed and the statements of account were scrutinised and thereafter the ITO passed orders of assessment. Under these circumstances, it was not for the assessee to draw what is called "pointed attention" of the ITO to the fact that extra shift allowance was being claimed on all electrical machinery and not merely electric motors. In any event, we are not concerned in the present proceedings with the merits or otherwise of the contentions as to whether the extra shift allowance could be claimed on the entire amount of Rs. 7,00,000 or only on the amount of Rs. 2,49,100, that being the value of electric motors used as part of textile machinery but ultimately, even if any mistake was committed it was because of an error on the part of the ITO in drawing the correct inference from the facts and law on the primary facts placed before him by the assessee and it cannot be said that there was an omission or failure on the part of the assessee to place primary facts or to disclose primary facts before the ITO. Under these circumstances, it is obvious that on the ground of extra shift allowance which was part of depreciation allowance allowed in the assessment years under consideration, it was not open to the ITO to seek to reopen the earlier assessment orders on the ground that there was an omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose truly and fully all material facts relating to those relevant assessment years.
As regards the item of balancing charge and capital gains flowing from the sales which were effected in the previous years relevant to the assessment years 1966-67 and 1967-68, it must be pointed out that the entire concept of balancing charge under
s. 41 (2)
turns upon the concept of depreciation allowance. It is because of the depreciation allowance granted in the previous years and the written down value being taken into consideration in the light of those earlier depreciation allowance that when the buildings, plant and machinery are sold on which depreciation was allowed in the past, the difference between the original cost and the written down value is treated as income under
s. 41(2)
by way of balancing charge. De hors or apart from the depreciation allowance, the concept of
s. 41(2)
does not exist and if any mistake occurred in depreciation allowance even in respect of these machineries which were sold, it cannot be said that the original cost of the seven Bowl Calender Machines which were sold in assessment year 1966-67 was Rs. 70,000 and the original cost of the Singeing Machine which was sold in the previous year 1967-68 was Rs. 84,000. In these facts were available on the record of the ITO at the time when he issued the notices on January 27, 1976, it was an omission on his part at the time when he passed the original assessment orders for 1966-67 and 1967-68, not to have ascertained from his own record what the cost was in respect of these pieces of machinery which were sold and not to have worked out the correct written down value and not to have worked out the correct balancing charge and also capital gains in respect of the seven Bowl Calender machines and the Singeing Machine in question. As pointed out earlier in the course of this judgment from the case of Ahmedabad Cotton Manufacturing Co. [1974] 95 ITR 639 (Guj), it is enjoined upon the ITO to work out the written down value for himself from his own record by consulting his own record if necessary and he cannot say that because he committed a mistake in the past in working out the correct written down value and on that basis the balancing charge under
s. 41(2)
, he can reopen the assessment under
s. 147(a)
.
In view of the decision of the Supreme Court in
Parashuram Potterys
case [1977] 106 ITR 1 (SC) and the decision of this court in
Ahmedabad Cotton Manufacturing Co.s
case [1974] 95 ITR 639 (Guj), it is obvious that even on the ground of
s. 41(2)
and on the ground of capital gain, it is not permissible for the ITO to reopen the assessment because in the past he accepted the statement of the petitioner-company at the time of the relevant assessment that the cost of the respective pieces of machinery which were sold in the relevant years was not available. We find from the copies which have been annexed to the orders that in the statement of account which were furnished along with the return for the relevant years when the machineries were sold, that it was clearly stated "cost not ascertained" and that statement was accepted even after checking up by the ITO concerned when he passed the original orders of assessment. If the ITO was remiss in not ascertaining the correct cost though it was available from his own record and could have been available from his record because he had to work out the cost for the purposes of depreciation allowance in the manner enjoined upon him by the
I.T. Act
, the assessee cannot be sought to be held liable on the ground of failure on his part to disclose fully or truly all the relevant facts.
On neither ground, therefore, on which reliance was placed in the letter of January 27, 1976, as grounds for reopening the assessment for the six years under consideration, was it open to the ITO to resort to the provisions of
s. 147(a)
and issue notices under
s. 148
. Since the condition precedent for the exercise of jurisdiction for reopening the assessment was not satisfied in respect of any of the years for which the notice were issued, this special civil application must be allowed and each of these notices, annex."E", collectively to the petition, must be quashed and set aside. This special civil application is allowed accordingly. Notices, annex."E", are quashed and set asides. Rule is made absolute accordingly. The respondents will pay the costs of this petition to the petitioner.

Bombay High Court
Bhalchandra Krishnarao Diwanji vs The State Of Bombay on 2 April, 1957
Equivalent citations: (1957)59BOMLR930
JUDGMENT
 

 Tambe, J.
1. This is a petition under
Article 226
of the Constitution of India by the President of the Municipal Committee, Badnera, for a suitable order or direction, or writ, to quash notification No. 4688-5656-M-XIII, dated October 10, 1956, published in the Madhya Pradesh Gazette dated October 12, 1956.
2. The undisputed facts are that the petitioner is a tax-payer and a voter of the Municipal Committee, Badnera. He was duly elected as the President of the said Committee on May 12, 1954 (The election of the President under the Central Provinces and Berar Municipalities Act is direct). Similarly, the Committee was constituted on May 12, 1954. The Government by notification No. 4638-5656-M-XIII, dated October 10, 1956, issued under Section 53-A of the Central Provinces and Berar Municipalities Act, 1922 (II of 1922), appointed Shri S.S. Chaube, Naib Tahasildar, as the Executive Officer of the Municipal Committee for a period of eighteen months from the date of his taking over charge and directed that Shri Chaube shall exercise and perform powers, duties and functions of the committee, president, vice-president and secretary to the exclusion of the committee, president, vice-president and secretary under certain provisions of the Act mentioned in the said notification. The petitioner has come to this Court under
Article 226
of the Constitution to quash this notification.
3. Before we proceed to deal with the application on merits, it is necessary to dispose of certain preliminary objections raised by the respondent. It is contended that the petitioner has no right to file this petition on behalf of the Municipal Committee. Allegations in para. 1 of the petition show that the petitioner purports to make this application on behalf of the Municipal Committee also. This contention is well founded. The petitioner has no right to act on behalf of the Municipal Committee. The petitioner, however, in para. 1 has stated that he was making this petition on his own behalf as well as on behalf of the Committee. The petitioner, therefore, will be allowed to prosecute the petition only on his own behalf, and not on behalf of the Municipal Committee.
4. It is next contended as a preliminary objection that the petitioner has no locus standi to file this petition on his behalf. The action has been taken against the Municipal Committee and the petitioner could have no grievance. It is not possible for us to accept this contention. Apart from the Municipal Committee, the petitioner has also his own grievance. As already stated, the petitioner was elected president directly to the Municipal Committee. The Central Provinces and Berar Municipalities Act provides certain procedure by which a President is prevented from exercising powers and perform duties of his office. If, in fact, he has been prevented from performing his functions as a President in a manner which contravenes the law, then, in our opinion, he has got a grievance and he could come up before us under
Article 226
of the Constitution. Dealing with similar matters the Nagpur High Court has entertained petitions filed by Presidents of Municipal Committees. See Gokal v. The State of M.P. (1950) N.L.J. 509; Tikaram v. Municipal Committee, Sindi
(1954) N.L.J. 683; and Rupnarayan Tondon v. State of M.P. (1955) N.L.J. 41. We see no good reason why we should take a view different from that taken in those cases.
5. Coming now to the merits of the petition, it is urged on behalf of the petitioner in the first instance that no opportunity was given to the Municipal Committee prior to the taking of the action, and the Municipal Committee was, therefore, deprived of an opportunity to give any explanations in respect of the charges framed against it. This contention has no force. It has been held by a Division Bench of the Nagpur High Court in President, Municipal Committee, Bhandara v. Deputy Commissioner, Bhandara [1956] Nag. 222 that no prior notice is required to be given to the Municipal Committee before any action is taken under Section 53-A of the Act though a prior notice is required for taking action under Section 57 of the Act. This view has been approved by a Division Bench of this Court to which one of us (Tambe J.) was a party in Miscellaneous Petition No. 330 of 1956, decided on February 21, 1957. We see no reason to take a different view.
6. In the second instance, it is urged that the Government has taken into consideration certain extraneous matters in taking the action, which they were not entitled to do under Section 53-A of the Act, and reference is made in this connection to instances Nos. (i), (ii) and (vi) mentioned in the said notification. As regards the other instances, it is said that these instances, even assuming to be true, do not establish any breach of a duty under the Act evidencing incompetency on the part of the Municipal Committee. This contention, in our view, appears to be well founded. It is urged, however, on behalf of opponent No. 1 that under the Act it is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the State Government to decide whether the Municipal Committee is competent to perform its duties, and if the State Government are of the opinion that the Municipal Committee is not competent, then that question cannot be gone into by a Court of law. It is not possible for us to accept this contention. The material part of Section 58-A of the Central Provinces and Berar Municipalities Act, 1922, reads as below :
If a committee is not competent to perform the duties imposed on it or undertaken by it by or under this Act, or any other enactment for the time being in force and the Provincial Government considers that a general improvement in the administration of the municipality is likely to be secured by the appointment of a servant of the Crown as the executive officer of the committee, the Provincial Government may, by an order stating the reasons therefor published in the Gazette, appoint such servant as the executive officer of the committee for such period not exceeding eighteen months as may be specified in such order.
It will be seen that the condition precedent for taking action under Section 53-A of the Act is the in competeney of the Municipal Committee to perform the duties imposed on it or undertaken by it by or under the Act or any other enactment for the time being in force. It will be further seen that the reasons for the action have to be stated in the Official Gazette. This will show that the action can be taken only when it can be objectively demonstrated from the reasons given by the Government in the notification that the Municipal Committee is not competent to perform the duties imposed on it or undertaken by it by or under the Act or any other enactment for the time being in force. The learned Counsel for opponent No. 2 was not in a position to cite any decision in support of his view. We, therefore, hold that it is open to us to examine whether the reasons given in the notification establish the
incompetency of the Municipal Committee to perform the duties imposed on it or undertaken by it by or under the Act or any other enactment for the time being in force.
7. Reading the notification above, it does appear that the grounds mentioned therein are based on the acts attributed to the Municipal Committee. But when it is read along with the return, it appears that the first, second and sixth grounds are not the acts of the Municipal Committee but are the acts of the President. We will assume for a moment that the President was not justified in acting in the. manner stated in the first, second and sixth instances, and in so acting he has committed a breach of the rules or bye-laws framed under the Act. But then what would justify an action under Section 53-A of the Act is the
incompetency of the Municipal Committee and not the wrongful acts of the President. It has not been alleged that the Municipal Committee has failed to take proper action against the President for his alleged wrongful acts. In our opinion, therefore, opponent No. ] was in error in relying on the acts mentioned in the first, second and sixth grounds in taking action under Sections 58-A of the Act.
8. As regards the third ground, it is said that the Municipal Employees' Union held a meeting in the Jai Hind Maidan for their grievances. This meeting turned into a public meeting and the President addressed the meeting and passed a resolution that the members of the Municipal Employees' Union should approach the municipal members in respect of 17 retrenched employees. It is suggested that the Municipal Committee should have taken appropriate action under Section 25-B(i)(c) of the Act. Section 25-B(I)(c) reads as follows :
No officer or servant employed under this Act shall take part in, subscribe in aid of, or assist in any way, any political movement or organisation carried on or run in any part of India or elsewhere relating to the affairs of India.
Now, it will be seen that what is prohibited by Section 25-B(1)(c) is taking part in a political movement or organization carried on or run in any part of India or elsewhere relating to the affairs of India. Now, the meeting which was held was only of the employees. It was for the purpose of ventilating their grievances. This cannot be called " taking part in any political movement "within the meaning of the section. On the facts stated in the notification itself, no breach of Section 25-B (1)(c) is brought out. This ground, therefore, cannot be relied on in support of the action taken under Section 53-A of the Act.
9. As regards the fourth ground, no facts are stated in the notification. In the return, however, opponent No. 1 has stated that the Municipal Committee was indebted to Government and as such the Committee had to submit its budget to the Deputy Commissioner not later than February 15, 1956 (vide Rule 5 of the rules under Sections 86 and 176(2)(iv) of the Act). The Committee actually submitted the budget to the Deputy Commissioner on March 12, 1956, and thus contravened the provisions of Rule 3. Though that is so, that contravention is not made a ground in the notification but something else which is not made out. Thus, this ground also is not established.
10. As regards the fifth ground mentioned in the notification, again the facts are not stated in the notification. The facts stated by opponant No. 1 in their return are that the budget was passed by the General Committee on February 17, 1956. It was not adhered to. On June 11, 1956, the General Committee approved certain alterations in the budget by passing a reappropriation budget as suggested by the President in his letter dated March 12, 1956. The action of the Municipal Committee, according to opponent No. 1, contravened the provisions of Section 84-A of the Act. Section 34-A of the Act provides that no subject once finally disposed of by a committee shall be reconsidered by it within six months unless the recorded consent of not less than three-fourths of its members has been obtained thereto, or unless the Provincial Government has directed its reconsideration. Now, in our view, Section 34-A has no application when we are dealing with a budget as specific and separate provisions arc made relating thereto in the rules framed under Sections 86 and 176(2)(iv) of the Act. These rules will, therefore, govern the case of a budget or reappropriation statements. Note (2) below Rule 6 framed under Sections 86 and 176(2)(iv) of the Act provides that reappropriation statements must be submitted as soon as the necessity for the same is foreseen and not after the expenditure has been taken in hand. Now, if the reappropriation statement is to be submitted as soon as the necessity therefor arises, it cannot be said that though there is necessity the reappropriation statement cannot be passed within six months of the passing of the budget. Now, in the instant case, it has got to be remembered that the Municipal Committee is indebted to the Government. The budget estimates have got to be submitted to Government for their sanction beforehand, and if the Municipal Committee feels the necessity of effecting certain changes in the budget once passed, it would be doing only the right thing in submitting its reappropriation statements as soon as it feels that necessity. It is not the case of opponent No. 1 that any expenditure has been incurred by the Municipal Committee without the reappropriation statements having been sanctioned by the Government. The fifth instance, therefore, is not made out on the facts stated in the return.
11. Since none of the grounds has been made out, we are clear that action under Section 53-A was wholly unjustified.
12. In the result, the petition is allowed with costs and the notification No. 4638-5656-M-XIII, dated October 10, 1956, is quashed. The petitioner will be entitled to a refund of the amount of the security deposit made by him after deducting the costs payable by him.

Customs, Excise and Gold Tribunal - Delhi
Bush India Ltd. vs Collector Of Customs on 10 December, 1997
Equivalent citations: 1998(100)ELT462(TRI-DEL)
ORDER
 

 Lajja Ram, Member (T)
1. These are three appeals filed by (1) M/s. Bush India Ltd. (2) Relectronics Pvt. Ltd. (3) Cauvery Electronics Pvt. Ltd. being aggrieved with three separate orders-in-original passed by the Collector of Customs, Bangalore. The matter in all these three appeals relates to the eligibility of the goods imported to the benefit of Notification No. 188/87-Cus., dated 29-4-1987 (as amended). As common issue for our consideration is involved in all these three appeals, they are being disposed of by this common order.
2.   When the matter was called no one appeared for the appellants. The notice for today's hearing has been issued to all the three appellants. In the interest of justice the matter was adjourned for today. Copy of the note-sheet so order out dated 5-9-1997 was sent to the appellants. As the matter is old in which the goods had been imported in the year 1988, we are proceeding to deal with the matters on merit after hearing Shri A.K. Agarwal, SDR.
3.   The appellants had imported electronic components and had declared the goods in question as resistor - variable (potentio meters). It had been claimed that the goods were eligible for the benefit of concessional rate of customs duty as available to the resistors (other than heating resistors) and potentio meters against Sr. No. 1 of the Table under Notification No. 188/87-Cus. The Adjudicating Authority had held that the goods in question were compact tuning unit with mounted Printed Circuit Board variable resistor and brand switches and were not eligible to the benefit of said notification which was available only to the resistor and potentio meters and not to the compact tuning unit in which the potentio meter was only one of the many components.
4.   We find that in the bill of entries the goods had been described as part No. E/1309 (B-100K)-Resistor - variable (potentio meters). The goods were assessed on the basis of the description as given by the importers. It was subsequently found that the benefit of Notification No. 188/87-Cus. had been allowed of on the basis of the incorrect description and that the goods were not mere potentio meters but were compact tuning unit with mounted printed circuit board variable resistor with brand switches. We find that the appellants had admitted that the item imported had got a mounted Printed Circuit Board along with the brand switches. They have, however, argued that even when the item imported had got a mounted PCB along with the brand switches, it does not mean that it would cease to be a potentio meters. Under Notification No. 188/87-Cus. Sr. No. 1 of the Table annexed to the said notification resistor (other than heating resistors) and potentio meters were eligible for the concessional rate of customs duty. The exemption is only to the resistor and potentio meters. In the electronic industries the potentio meters had a definite understanding. Of course there are different types of potentio meters. But the tuning unit is as such is different from the potentio meters which only form one of the component of the tuning unit.
5.   The exemption notification had to be construed strictly and when in the exemption notification No. 188/87-Cus. the resistor and potentio meters were included for the purposes of the benefit of concessional rate of customs duty, the benefit was only available to the resistors and potentio meters if imported as such and not to any unit in which the resistors and potentio meters might have been used.
6.   The appellants had contended that the term potentio meter had not been defined in the Customs Tariff. We find that as per technical literature produced in the appeal from M/s. Relectronics Pvt. Ltd. they are a well recognised raw material and component in the electronics industry. We also find from the McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Science and Technology (Page 708-710) that the potentio meter (variable resistors) is a variable resistance device with three terminals used in electric circuits. It is used to adjust and control the electric potentio (voltage) applied to some device of part of a circuit. It could be a linear or non-linear. The appellants have referred to the description in the import policy where potentio meter with PCB mounting had been covered for the purposes of import under OGL. We consider that when the entry had been amended to cover potentio meters with PCB mounting it when not to be said that they were covered by the earlier description of potentio meters and rheostats of device. As in the exemption notification the description used was simply resistors and potentio meters we consider that benefit of exemption Notification No. 188/87-Cus. was not available to the goods imported.
7.   The ld. Collector of Customs, Bangalore had dealt with the matter in detail and had discussed the various contentions raised by the appellants. He had also referred to the product description and technical literature and had come to a decision that the goods imported were not mere potentio meters and that the importers had wilfully omitted to give full description of the goods and had mislead the Department by simply describing the goods as potentio meters just to avail the-benefit of notification which was not available for the goods under consideration.
8.   A reference had been made in the show cause notice and in the adjudication order to the clarification given by the Department of Electronics. The appellants have pleaded that this clarification was not made available to them. We find that the adjudicating authority had discussed the matter in detail and had come to his decision on merits and that the clarification from the Department of Electronics had been mentioned just to confirm his view. We do not consider that in the facts and circumstances of the case non-supply of the clarification had in any manner adversely affected the interest of the appellants.
9.   Taking all the relevant facts and considerations into account we do not find any material to interfere with the view taken by the Adjudicating Authority in all the three cases. We also consider that the amount of penalty imposed in all these three cases was reasonable and do not call for any interference.
10.   In view of the above discussion we do not find any merit in these three appeals. All the three appeal are rejected. Ordered accordingly.

Customs, Excise and Gold Tribunal - Delhi
Escorts Ltd. vs Collector Of Central Excise on 9 June, 1997
Equivalent citations: 1997(93)ELT707(TRI-DEL)
ORDER
U.L. Bhat, J. (President)
1. Appellant, engaged in the manufacture of motorcycles falling under erstwhile T.I. 34, had filed price lists stating that the price did not include a sum of Rs. 150 per motorcycle which was proposed to be collected towards equalised freight and insurance charges and the said amount was not liable to be included in the assessable value. Price lists having been approved, appellant cleared motorcycles from time to time paying duty on the assessable value as declared in the price lists. Motorcycles were being transported from the factory gate to the premises of the dealers in special trucks built by the appellant with several deckers so that one truck can carry quite a large number of motorcycles.
2.   Dispute in this case relates to the year 1983. On 14-10-1987 notice was issued to the appellant stating that the appellant had failed to declare the correct assessable value of the goods and pay correct duty of central excise and motorcycles had been cleared without payment of proper duty. The notice further alleged that scrutiny of private accounts maintained by the assessee and the written confirmation of the appellant disclosed that a sum of Rs. 1,65,31,604.98 had been collected during the year on account of freight, forwarding and insurance while actually incurring expenditure of only Rs. 1,13,14,381.20. Thus there was net benefit of Rs. 52,17,222.78. The show cause notice alleged that this differential amount became part of the assessable value under
Section 4
of the Central Excise Act, 1944, on which duty would be payable. Collection of excess amount was made without disclosing the facts to the department in the price lists or subsequently and facts had been suppressed. Therefore, larger period of limitation under the proviso to
Section 11A
of the Act was available. The notice further proposed demand of differential duty on the differential amount, imposition of penalty, confiscation of land, building, plant and machinery etc. Appellant resisted the notice on various grounds including the one based on limitation. However, the Principal Collector overruled the contentions and confirmed the duty demand and imposed penalty of Rs. 50,000/-. This order is now challenged.
3.   Shri P.S. Bedi, Consultant representing the appellant submitted that equalised freight for 1983 was based on the actuals of 1982 and was only an estimate and in a year the estimate may be more than the actual cost which may be incurred thereafter and in some years estimate may be less than the actual amount incurred. In 1984 and 1985 amounts collected were less than the amounts expended. Learned Consultant placed reliance on the decisions of the Supreme Court in Bombay Tyre International Ltd. -1983 (14) E.L.T. 1896, MRF Ltd. -1995 (77) E.L.T. 433 and 1989 (41) E.L.T. 376 for the proposition that when freight had been equalised the same cannot be part of assessable value. He also placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Oxygen Ltd. -1988 (36) E.L.T. 730 (S.C.), where the Court observed that the supply of cylinders (in the case of gas) was an activity ancillary to the manufacture of gas and any income either in the shape of interest on deposit received for the safe return of cylinders, or any rental charge would not be part of the price of manufactured goods and the same might be profit or gain of the ancillary or allied venture and therefore the amount in dispute could not be included in the assessable value as defined in
Section 4(1) (a)
of the Act. These contentions are rebutted by Shri M. Ali, JDR.
4.   The first two decisions of the Supreme Court have been considered by us in Baroda Electric Meters Ltd. v. CCE, Ahmedabad - 1996 (85) E.L.T. 363 (Tribunal) and we observed as follows :
"It is no doubt true that the wholesale cash price of the goods at the factory gate as declared by the appellant in the price list is available. But in most of the cases the price list also refers to the freight and insurance charges and also the total prices. Freight and insurance charges cannot be part of the assessable value but wherever freight and insurance charges actually met are less than the amount collected by way of freight and transport charges, it is not the appellant's case that the difference was being refunded to the Electricity Boards. In fact, the difference was not intended to be refunded, but intended to be appropriated by the manufacturer. If the difference was so appropriated by the manufacturer and there is no dispute that it was so appropriated, that would become part of the price of the goods in which case the same would be legitimately part of the assessable value."
5.   The above proposition would hold good except in cases where the principle in Indian Oxygen Ltd. case could be successfully invoked. In order that principle of Indian Oxygen Ltd. case can be invoked, the assessee must have a case that the activity in question was regarded as an ancillary or allied profit making venture. If assessee has earned profit in a specific case the same should be considered in the light of the decision of Indian Oxygen Ltd. Where however the assessee has not put forward such a case, the principle would not be attracted.
6.   The main contention urged by the learned Consultant on behalf of the appellant is that while the figures Rs. 1,65,31,604.98 and Rs. 1,13,14,381.20 are correct, the latter figure is not exhaustive of all the factors which contributed to the actual freight expenses. To illustrate, it was submitted by Shri Bedi that the cost of fuel and salary of drivers may have been taken into consideration but the cost of designing the specially manufactured truck, salary of those personnel who are required to devote some time on the maintenance, upkeep, repair of the truck, the cost of spare parts for the special truck during the year in question and similar other expenses have not been taken into consideration in arriving at the figure of actual expenses. We find a slight contradiction between the show cause notice and the impugned order. While the show cause notice alleged that the figures are taken from "private accounts" maintained by the assessee, the order states that the figures are taken from Balance Sheets. In our opinion, it was necessary for the Collector to have furnished to the appellant the calculation data on the basis of which the cost of freight was arrived at Rs. 1,13,14,381.20. If the data sheet had been supplied the appellant would have been in a" position to point out omissions, if any, and the Collector would have been in a position to consider the same. We are of the opinion that in this state-of-affairs 'what is necessary to find is whether equalised freight was in excess of the actual freight and if so to what extent.
7.   For the reasons indicated above, we set aside the impugned order and remand the case to the jurisdictional adjudicating authority for decision afresh after supplying the appellant the data on the basis of which the actual expenditure on freight and insurance charges had been arrived at and after giving the appellant an opportunity to rebut the correctness of the calculation. The adjudicating authority will also have to consider the question of limitation in the light of the contentions raised by both the parties. The actual expenditure should be arrived at on consideration of relevant aspects. Naturally, on the basis of such findings the question of imposition of penalty has also to be considered.
8.   The appeal is allowed.

Supreme Court of India
Madanraj vs Jalamchand Lodha And Anr. on 27 January, 1959

JUDGMENT
 

Gajendragadkar, J.
1. This appeal by special leave is directed against the order passed by the High Court of Madras by which the order of acquittal passed in favour of the appellant by the trial magistrate has been set aside and the proceedings have been remitted to the court below for disposal in accordance with, law. The appellant is a pawn-broker of Ambattur near Madras. He had a Katha account with the complainant Jalamchand Lodha under which on November 3, 1956, he owed him Rs. 15,000; as security for the said sum and in accordance with the custom obtaining in Katha transactions the appellant had placed gold and silver, jewels valued at about Rs. 15,000 in a locked box kept with the said complainant, the key of the lock remaining with the appellant. The case against the appellant was that he visited the complainant's house between November 3, 1956 and April 9, 1957 for transacting business with him when he opened the locked box and took away a large number of gold and silver jewels. On April 9, 1957, the complainant discovered that the appellant had removed from the said box jewels and silver articles worth Rs. 14,000 without his knowledge or consent. On these facts alleged by the complainant a charge-sheet was submitted against the appellant under
Section 380
of the Indian Penal Code.
2. At the trial the complainant gave evidence in support of his case and relied upon two documents executed by the appellant, the promissory note for Rs. 15,745 (Ex. P-l) (3-11-1956) and the agreement (Ex. P-2) (9-4-1957). In the latter document the appellant had admitted that for the amount of Rs. 15,745 due by him to the complainant the appellant's jewels box had been kept with the complainant and that out of the said box jewels or the value of Rs. 14,000 had been taken away by the appellant without the complainant's knowledge. The appellant promised to bring the jewels back from his house and put them in the box by April 15, 1957, but he failed to keep his promise.
3. The appellant contended before the trial magistrate that these documents had been executed by him under coercion, threat and undue influence practised on him by the complainant. The learned magistrate rejected this contention and found that the appellant had in fact removed the valuables from the box and had voluntarily promised to restore them by April 15, 1957. He, however, held that, in the circumstances of the case, the jewels and other valuables in question could not be said to have been in the possession of the complainant within the meaning of
Section 378
of the Indian Penal Code. That is why he took the view that the offence of theft had not been proved against the appellant and so he acquitted him of the said offence.
4. This order of acquittal was challenged by the complainant by his revisional application before the High Court of Madras. The High Court took the view that the conclusion of the magistrate as to the requirements of
Section 378
of the Code was unsustainable having regard to the facts which the learned magistrate had himself found. Indeed the High Court was disposed to characterise the said conclusion as perverse. In the result the High Court held that, in the interests of justice, the order of acquittal should be set aside and the case should be sent back for disposal in accordance with law in the light of the observations made by the High Court in its judgment. It is against this order that the present appeal has been filed.
5. At the hearing of this appeal Mr. Mani, for the appellant, sought to challenge the competence of the revisional application filed by the complainant under
Section 439
of the Criminal Procedure Code. He contended that the present proceedings are governed by the Code as amended in 1955 and he argued that
Section 439 (5)
of the Code expressly prohibits any proceedings by way of revision in cases where an appeal lies and no appeal has been brought. According to Mr. Mani, the complainant had a right to apply to the High Court for special leave to appeal against the order of acquittal under
Section 417
, Sub-section (3) of the Code and since he has not exercised the said right it was not open to him to move the High Court in its revisional jurisdiction under
Section 439
of the Code. When we enquired whether this point had been raised before the High Court we were told by the learned advocates appearing for the complainant and the State that no such contention had been raised be fore the High Court. If this contention had been raised before the High Court, it would have considered it on the merits and it might have, if necessary, allowed the complainant to convert his application for revision filed under
Section 439
into an application for special leave under
Section 417(3)
. In the circumstances of this case we do not think we should allow Mr. Mani to raise this point for the first time in his appeal under
Article 136.
6. Then Mr. Mani contended that the High Court was in error in coming to the conclusion that prima facie the essential ingredients of
Section 378
had been proved in this case. According to him, the jewels and other ornaments were kept in the box which remained with the complainant as a notional security and that it was always open to the appellant to take out the ornaments from the said box as he liked. He also suggested that the document (Ex. P-2) on which reliance was placed against him in the courts below had been executed by the appellant under coercion and undue influence. We do not think the appellant is entitled to raise these contentions at this stage in the present appeal. All that the High Court has done is to direct that the case should be tried afresh. In its very nature the order of remand passed by the High Court does not finally decide the points in the case and it is essentially of an interlocutory character. We do not propose to express any opinion On the observations made by the High Court because we are anxious that the further trial of the case should not be prejudiced one way or the other by whatever we may say. This Court does not generally interfere with interlocutory orders under
Article 136
, and we see no reason to depart from the usual practice in the present case. If the appellant wants to urge any grounds against the prosecution case either On law or on facts, it would be open to him to raise them at the trial before the court which will take up this case. We wish to express no opinion on the said points.
7. Mr. Mani then invited our attention to the fact that on February 10, 1958, the complainant has filed a suit (Civil Suit No. 41 of 1958) on the promissory note in question; and he suggested that all further proceedings in the criminal case remanded by the High Court should be stayed pending the disposal of the civil suit. On the other hand it has been urged before us by the respondents that, even if the complainant does not get a decree for the full amount claimed by him in the plaint, that would not affect the merits of his complaint in the criminal case. On this point again we propose to express no opinion. It would be open to the appellant, if so advised, to take proper steps to apply for a stay of criminal proceedings and if such an application is made by him we have no doubt that it would be dealt with in accordance with law.
8. In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed.

                  inclined to direct release of the petitioner from custody. The petition is

                  dismissed.
However, as soon as petitioner completes one year in

Need To Allow Students Of Centre For Excellence Courses In Iits For Applying To ... on 15 March, 2010
> 

  

Title: Need to allow students of Centre for Excellence courses in IITs for applying to jobs in PSUs.
SHRIMATI
BOTCHA JHANSI LAKSHMI
(
VIZIANAGARAM
): Thank you, Madam Chairman, for giving me an opportunity to raise a matter of urgent public importance.
As you know, the Centre of Excellence courses were started during 2005-06 onwards in various ITIs in different sectors across the country.  In this connection, in Andhra Pradesh,  they were started under different schemes like domestic, World Bank, PPP mode with Rs. 3.5 crore of grants for each ITI.  In my State, about 29 Government ITIs were upgraded with the World Bank assistance as Centre of Excellence (CoE).
The course curriculum had been designed by the Director-General of Employment and Training, New Delhi and recognized by the NCVT with multi-skill orientation, which is the present requirement of the Indian industry; and the courses were very advanced when compared to the regular ITI general trades with a vision of producing world-class work force.
In this connection , in spite of this, the trainees trained in the CoE were not allowed to apply in the public sector industries and the Central Government organizations like the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, Naval Dock Yard, RRB, Defence, and Railways in their recruitments. Though the trainees were well trained on the modern machinery along with plant training who have acquired advanced skills, they are being denied opportunities in the above-mentioned organizations. They are not recognizing the courses approved by the NCVT.
In view of this, I would request, through you, Madam Chairman, the hon. Minister to take suitable steps to consider the Centre of Excellence trainees in the recruitment to the public sector industries and other Central Government organizations at par with the general ITI trades; otherwise the students trained in the Centre of Excellence under trades would be rendered jobless.
I would also request the Ministry to ensure that specified skills at industry for six months may also be considered as apprenticeship and allow them to appear for apprenticeship trade tests in the concerned industry.
MADAM CHAIRMAN : Now, the House stands adjourned to meet again tomorrow, that is, 16th March, 2010 at 11 a.m.   

    

 18.31 hrs   The Lok Sabha then adjourned till Eleven of the Clock on

The Depot Manager, Andhra Pradesh
State Road Transport Corpn. & Anr.           ...Appellants.

Versus

V.Surender                                       ...
Respondent
                             ORDER
1.   The respondent was appointed as Cleaner in the

appellant-Corporation in the year 1979. In 1991, he was

unauthorisedly absent and there was no information to the

Corporation as to why he was not attending the duty. In this

view of the matter, the Corporation was constrained to issue

a charge sheet on 16th of May, 1991. In reply, the respondent

submitted a sickness certificate on 21.6.1991 to cover up his

absence. Since the Corporation was not satisfied with the

explanation offered by the respondent, an enquiry officer was

appointed to enquire the charges levelled against the
2
respondent and basing on report of the enquiry officer, finally

the respondent was removed from service on 24th of April,

1991. An industrial dispute was thereafter raised by the

respondent against the said order of removal and finally the

Labour Court, Hyderabad by its Award dated 12th of March,

1997 held that the orders of removal for the misconduct was

harsh and disproportionate and, therefore, could not be

sustained. The Award of the Labour Court was challenged by

the Corporation, which by the impugned order was affirmed.

However, the High Court by the impugned order directed the

Corporation not to pay 25% of the back wages. Feeling

aggrieved by the concurrent orders of the Labour Court as

well as the High Court, this SLP was filed which on grant of

leave was heard in the presence of the learned counsel for

the parties.
2.    We have heard the learned counsel for the parties

and after going through the impugned orders, we are of the

view that the order of the High Court need not be interfered

with excepting that the payment of any back wages in the

facts and circumstances should not be directed to be paid to
3
the respondent. Accordingly, we dispose of this appeal by

modifying the award of the Labour Court and by holding that

the respondent is not entitled to any back wages from the

Corporation. It is made clear that if the respondent has not

yet been reinstated, he shall be reinstated within two months

from the date of supply of a copy of this order. The appeal is

thus disposed of with the aforesaid modification. There will

be no order as to costs.

              Dated this the 12th day of March, 2009

                                JUDGMENT
The petitioner has approached this Court, aggrieved by the order

of transfer Ext.P2. As per Ext.P2, the petitioner was transferred from

Alappuzha and posted as Electrical Inspector in Kannur. Petitioner

challenged the same before this Court filing W.P.(C) No.3804 of 2008.

This Court directed the respondents to consider the grievance raised

by the petitioner in Ext.P3 representation. He was also allowed to file a

supplementary representation in the matter. Petitioner is permanently

settled in Ernakulam and the third respondent is a native of Angamaly.

He had also sought for accommodation in an open vacancy which

would arise Thrissur on 1.3.2008. The third respondent also submitted

his written consent as per Ext.P6. The vacancy which was due to arise

in Thrissur was a promotion vacancy. By Ext.P7, again the petitioner's

request was rejected stating that no change is required. Petitioner

contend for the position that the said order was passed without

considering the directions issued by this Court and without considering

the grievance raised by the petitioner.
2. While admitting this writ petition, this Court passed an interim

order on 11.04.2008 directing the first respondent to consider the

posting of the petitioner in the vacancy at Thrissur, if it is not filled up

so far.
wpc: 12919 of 2009
2
3. Respondents have filed a counter affidavit stating that there

was no vacancy at Thrissur at the time of issuance of Ext.P7. The

order passed by the Government is not justified on the ground that

competent claims have been considered while taking the decision.
4. The learned standing counsel appearing for the petitioner

submits that in the vacancy that arose in Thrissur another person has

been accommodated already. The petitioner is a native of Ernakulam

district and therefore, he is seeking for a transfer to Ernakulam or in

Alappuzha.
5.  Now the general transfer 2009 is due.         Earlier, he was

working in Wayanad from where he was transferred to Alappuzha. The

claim of the petitioner will be considered during the General Transfer,

2009. Appropriate orders will be passed by taking note of the fact that

the petitioner had been agitating for a transfer back, in the earlier writ

petition and again in the present one.
The writ petition is disposed of accordingly.

18.   22.6.2010
The petitioner, common in all these

                three    cases,        has     sought      a     direction     for

                payment of salary in two of them, namely,

                C.W.J.C.No.            7170/1994           and        C.W.J.C.No.

                3659/1995,       whereas       in    C.W.J.C.No.        762/1995

                he     seeks      to        challenge          the     order    of

                absorption of respondent no.5 on the ground

                that    such    absorption           would     mean    automatic

                termination            of      the      service         of     the

                petitioner, inasmuch as the post of Lecturer

                in Rameshwar Singh College, Muzaffarpur is

                being    claimed        both    by    the      petitioner      and

                respondent no.5.
It is also not in doubt that the

                said College in question was an affiliated

                College and was taken over by the University

                in the year 1981 pursuant to a decision of

                the     State     Government          to       take    over    103

                Colleges        (3rd        phase     of       takeover).      The

                condition of takeover was already formulated

                by the State Government and the University
3
could have taken over service of teaching

and non-teaching employees only as per the

conditions imposed by the State Government

in its decision with regard to takeover of

103 Colleges.
In        this        case     there        is     an

appointment letter issued in favour of the

petitioner by the Principal of the College

which is not backed by any advertisement.

Counsel       for    the       petitioner,        however,      has

stated that there was an advertisement prior

to the order of appointment issued by the

Principal of the affiliated College.
On the other hand, respondent no.5

in     his    counter          affidavit     in        C.W.J.C.No.

762/1995 has categorically asserted that an

advertisement           in     newspaper         was     published

only     in    the       month       of    March,       2000    and

therefore, the claim of the petitioner of

being         appointed             on     the         basis     of

advertisement has been seriously questioned.

In      any        event        when       the     petitioner's

appointment is said to be made in the month

of   January,        1980      by    the   Principal       of   the

College and there is a recommendation of the

College Service Commission on 13.9.1980 as
4
with regard to only a leave reserved post,

the   records       will          have    to    show     that   the

college/the commission had infact advertised

the said leave reserve post on the basis of

which the Commission would have given its

approval as is sought to be conveyed by the

document in question filed by the petitioner

showing      temporary             recommendation         of    the

College Service Commission for a period of

one   year    or       till       the    availability      of   the

sanctioned        post       on    which       the   petitioner's

approval/ concurrence was sought to be given

by the Commission.
Counsel for the petitioner, however

has   submitted           that          this    Court     is    not

required      to    go       into       all    these     questions

because      there       is       an    order    of     suspension

issued       by        the        University           which    was

ultimately withdrawn by the University and

that by itself will at least go to show that

after the College had become a constituent

unit of the University the service of the

petitioner had been taken over and he could

continue      at        least           till     the     date    of

consideration of his case for absorption by

the University which infact had rejected his
5
case for being absorbed on the post and on

which    respondent       no.5      has     been     ultimately

absorbed by the University

              In the opinion of this Court even

in an affiliated College the appointment of

Lecturer        was      well         regulated        by       the

provisions       of     the     Act     and    the       Statutes

whether under 1960 Act or under 1976 Act.

Such      regulation            never         provided          for

appointment by the Principal of the College.
The next issue, therefore, would be

when      the     Commission            also       has      given

concurrence on a post of leave vacancy to

the petitioner and that too for a limited

period of one year, it would be difficult to

understand        that        the       service        of       the

petitioner could be ever taken over in terms

of section 4(14) of the Act read with the

condition imposed by the State Government in

the order taking over 103 Colleges in the

year 1980.
Unfortunately         there     is   a     complete

silence    on     the   part     of     the    University        to

give    any     details   on     these      aspects       and   in

fact there is counter affidavit on behalf of

the University explaining these aspects.
6
This Court in fact would also find

it difficult to decide the question as to

whether     the       mark-sheet        submitted      by     the

petitioner        of     his   qualifying         Master       of

Science Examination was forged or otherwise,

inasmuch    as     the    University         while     allowing

absorption      of      respondent       no.5    through      its

Absorption       Committee        had    found    the       mark-

sheet    submitted        by   the      petitioner       to   be

forged. Counsel for the petitioner, however,

would submit that on an earlier occasion the

Absorption Committee of the University had

found some other ground and had advised the

petitioner         to      seek         absorption          under

different    Statutes.         The      whole    question     in

fact    would     be    whether        the   petitioner       was

qualified under any of the Statutes framed

by the Chancellor for being absorbed as a

teacher of the College. This aspect again

involving question of facts can be gone into

in a graphic manner by the author of the

Statutes himself, namely, Chancellor of the

University.
The        scope      of     enquiry        to     be

undertaken        by     the   Chancellor         of     course
unlimited u/s 9(4) of the Act being quite
7
vast,       it     will         be     also        open      for      the

Chancellor          to     go        into     the        legality      of

appointment of the petitioner and respondent

no.5    so    as    to     confer          him     the     benefit    of

being absorbed in the College.
In that view of the matter, this

Court       would       deem     it        expedient        that      the

matter is decided by the Hon'ble Chancellor

who in exercise of his power u/s 9(4)of the

Act     will        examine           as      to      whether         the

appointment of the petitioner and absorption

in    the    College       was        permissible           so   as    to

allow        him     to        question           the       order     of

absorption         passed       in     favour         of   respondent

no.5. Since everything will depend on the

outcome       of     the       legality          of      appointment/

absorption of the petitioner, the validity

of absorption order of respondent no.5 will

only be gone into after it is held that the

appointment of the petitioner was valid.
Since       these        writ        petitions        have

remained pending for a very long period from

1994    onwards,         this        Court       would      only    hope

that    the        Chancellor          would        find     time      to

dispose of the matter as early as possible

preferably         within       a     period       of      six   months
8
from the date of receipt/production of copy

            of this order.
With the aforementioned observation

            and direction, these writ applications are

            disposed of.

ORDER
 

A.M. Sapre, J.
1. By filing this writ under
Article 227
of the Constitution of India the petitioner seeks to challenge the appellate order dated December 17, 2004 (annexure P/7) passed by the Commercial Tax Appellate Board in three appeals.
2. By the impugned order the cases have been remanded to competent assessing authority for making assessment in the cases of petitioner under the provisions of the M.P. Commercial Tax Act, 1994. It is these remand orders which are sought to be impugned by the petitioner in this writ.
3. Heard A.K. Sethi, learned Counsel for petitioner, and Shri AS. Kutumbale, learned AAG, for respondents.
4. Having heard learned Counsel for the parties and having perused the record of the case I find no substance in this writ. It is accordingly dismissed in limine.
5. Firstly, remand order being perfectly in accordance with law. No interference in the remand order is called for. Secondly even the petitioner has not seriously challenged the remand order in this writ. Thirdly, as a consequence of remand the case has to go back to the competent assessing authority to make assessment for the period in question.
6. I am unable to appreciate the submission of learned Counsel for the petitioner when he contended that while remanding the case, the appellate authority, i.e., Board had no jurisdiction to give any direction to that authority against whose order the appeal was not filed. In other words the submission as I understood was that the appellate authority can while remanding the case give direction to that authority against whose order the appeal was filed and in which the remand was made. According to learned Counsel since in this case the impugned direction to make assessment after remand is not to the same assessing authority against whose order the appeal was filed but it is to an altogether new assessing officer and hence it is not permissible. As observed supra, I am not impressed by this submission which has no merit.
7. In this case, the original assessment was made by an authority (A.O.) who was held to have no jurisdiction to assess. It was for this reason that the direction is issued to that A.O. who has jurisdiction to make the assessment. Indeed the assessee cannot escape their liability to get themselves assessed. The appellate authority has full power to send the case to a proper assessing authority who is invested with the assessing powers to make assessment in the case of petitioner.
8. I am, therefore, of a considered view that this petition has no merit. It is accordingly dismissed in limine. The assessing authority should now ensure expeditious disposal of assessment case of the petitioner.

Madras High Court
E.I.D. Parry (India) Ltd. vs Agricultural Officer (Quality ... on 10 November, 1988
Equivalent citations: 1989(42)ELT218(MAD)
JUDGMENT
 

David Annoussamy, J.
1. These petitions coming on for hearing upon perusing these petitions, and the Affidavit filed with Crl. M.P. No. 2365 of 1988 on the file of the High Court, and upon hearing the arguments of Mr. C.A. Sundaram, Advocate for the petitioners in each of the petitions, and of Mr. T. Munirathina Naidu for Public Prosecutor, on behalf of the Respondent in both the petitions, the Court made the following order :-
These are two petitions under
Section 482
of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 2365 of 1988 is by accused 1 to 3, 5 to 9 and 11. Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 2851 of 1988 is by accused 4 and 10. The 12th accused has not filed any petition. The substance of the complaint was that there was a violation by accused 1, the company, and by the other accused, who belong to the company in their various capacities, of Clause 13(1) of the Fertilizer Control Act, 1957 and that thereby they become punishable under
Section 7(1)(a)(ii)
of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The complainant also prayed that in accordance with the judgment of this Court reported in Mounaguruswamy v. Agrl. Officer (Inputs) 1985 MLJ (Crl.) 154 the concerned Magistrate to commit the accused to the
Essential Commodities Act
Court. The Magistrate has issued summons to all the accused to appear before him to answer the charge. Aggrieved by that proceeding of the Magistrate, eleven out of the twelve accused have preferred these two petitions, praying this Court to quash the case on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Dharapuram (P.R.C. No. 6 of 1988).
2.   The learned Counsel for the petitioners submitted that as far as the company, the first accused was concerned, the complaint was preferred only on 30-3-1988, after more than three years from the date of the alleged sample was taken, that this inordinate delay was not explained in the complaint and that such a delay would deprive it from effectively setting out its case and meeting the charge. As far as the other petitioners accused are concerned, in addition to the above plea, the learned Counsel would state that as per
Section 10
of the Essential Commodities Act only the persons, who were in charge of or were responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company shall be guilty of the contravention, and not the others, and that the complainant has not even alleged that the other accused were in any manner in charge of or responsible to the company for the conduct of the business. Further, the learned Counsel for the petitioners stated that the Act of issuing summons in a case of this nature was a very important one since it affected the reputation of the persons concerned and also would cause much inconvenience, if they happened to be simply discharged after hearing them, since they reside at places far away from the Court.
3.   It is submitted now by the learned Counsel appearing for the Public Prosecutor that the judgment reported in Mounaguruswamy v. Agrl. Officer (Inputs) is no longer good law, that it is not necessary to present the complaint under the
Essential Commodities Act
to the territorial Judicial Magistrate and that the complaint should be presented directly to the
Essential Commodities Act
Court. He relied for this purpose on the judgment of this Court rendered in C.A. No. 179 of 1984 on 23-9-1988.
That decision itself is based on the decision of the Supreme Court in
A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak
. The position regarding committal is being now settled, the complaint can no longer be entertained by the Magistrate for any purpose, and therefore the summonses which he had issued have necessarily to be quashed and the complaint be sent to the concerned Court under the
Essential Commodities Act
.
4.   The learned Counsel for the petitioners is right in contending that the issue of process is not a mechanical operation, that it should be the result of application of mind, that the Court has to satisfy himself that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against each one of the accused. Therefore the Court will have to peruse the complaint and the relevant provisions of law and issue process only it he finds that such a measure is warranted.
5.   Another apprehension expressed by the learned Counsel for the petitioners is that the proceeding being a summary in nature, there will be a risk for the accused of being tried on the very day of their appearance without framing charge etc. It is true that as per
Section 251
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it is not necessary to frame a formal charge; what the section requires is that the substance of the charge should be perfectly clear in the mind of the Court and made clear to the minds of the accused persons. In matters like the present ones, where there is a provision for minimum imprisonment and possibility of imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for a term upto two years, it is always desirable to frame a formal charge.
6.    At any rate, the first duty of the Special Court would be to ascertain whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding as required under
Section 204
, Cr.P.C. With the above direction, the complaint is forwarded to the Special Court constituted under the
Essential Commodities Act
, Coimbatore, and that Special Court shall deal with the matter de novo. All the records received from the Magistrate shall also be forwarded to that Court and the Magistrate shall be informed of that operation.
3.   In the result, both the petitions are allowed only to the extent that the summons issued by the Judicial First Class Magistrate of Dharapuram are quashed.

Madras High Court
Gandi Appa Razu vs King-Emperor on 11 November, 1919
Equivalent citations: (1920)ILR 43MAD330
JUDGMENT
 

Krishnan, J.
1. It is contended on behalf of the petitioner the first accused, that the learned Sessions Judge had no jurisdiction to order his committal to the Sessions on charges under
Sections 147
and
304
, Indian Penal Code, and that his order to that effect must be set aside.
2. As regards the charge under
Section 147
, Indian Penal Code, we think the contention is well-founded, as the accused was acquitted by the Sub-Magistrate on that charge, under
Section 258
, Criminal Procedure Code. So long as that order of acquittal stands, he cannot be again charged and tried for that offence on the same facts.
Section 403
, Criminal Procedure Code, is a bar to it. It was not open to the Sessions Judge to set aside that acquittal, or to treat it merely as an order of discharge as he seems to have done. His order so far as it refers to
Section 147
, Indian Penal Code, must therefore be set aside.
3. But the charge under
Section 304
, Indian Penal Code, stands on a different tooting. Though the complaint alleged facts against this accused constituting an offence under
Section 302
, Indian Penal Code, the Sub-Magistrate disbelieved the evidence on the point, and did not frame any charge under
Section 302
, or 304,
Indian Penal Code
. His action amounted in law to an order of discharge on those counts, even though no express order of discharge was recorded by him. See
Krishna Reddi v. Subbamma
(1901) I.L.R., 24 Mad., 136. That being so, it was open to the Sessions Judge under
Section 436
, Criminal Procedure Code, to act suo motu and set aside the implied discharge and direct the committal of the accused to the Sessions on being satisfied that he had been improperly discharged, as the offence under
Section 304
, Indian Penal Code, is one exclusively triable by the Sessions Court.
4. But it is argued that the District Magistrate had passed a previous order, on an application by the complainant, refusing to set aside that discharge, and that that order prevents the Sessions Judge, who is a co-ordinate authority with the District Magistrate, from re-opening the matter, and reliance is placed on the ruling in Kalimuthu v. Emperor (1903) I.L.R., 26 Mad., 477. It was ruled in that case, that under Clause (4) of
Section 435
, Criminal Procedure Code, it was not competent to the District Magistrate to entertain an application to commit, when the Sessions Judge had already refused to pass such an order, and that the reason of the prohibition applied equally to cases in which the authorities acted suo motu. It would not of course matter whether the District Magistrate or the Sessions Judge acted in the first instance, as they are co-ordinate authorities under the section.
5. It seems to us however that this ruling is not applicable to the facts of the present case. What happened here was that as soon as the Sub-Magistrate framed charges under
Sections 147
,
323
and
325
, Indian Penal Code, against the first accused and while the case was still pending before him, the first prosecution witness put in an application to the District Magistrate under
Section 435
, Criminal Procedure Code, asking him to call for the records and direct a committal of the case to the Sessions. The prosecution was a police prosecution though it was on the information of prosecution witness No. 1. The District Magistrate sent the petition to the District Superintendent of Police recording on it that he was not inclined to stay proceedings or to call for the records; finally he rejected the petition on the ground that the police, in whose hands the case was, were satisfied with the procedure of the Magistrate. Now, it will be noticed that at the time the application was made, there was no express order of discharge as to
Section 304
, Indian Penal Code, nor could an order of discharge be implied under the authority of
Krishna Reddi v. Subbamma
(1901) I.L.R., 24 Mad., 136, above referred to, as the trial had not come to a close as
in that case
, and it was still open to the Sub-Magistrate to frame further charges' and commit under
Section 347
, Criminal Procedure Code, if he thought fit to do so. There was thus no order of discharge to revise, and the application cannot be looked upon as one for that purpose The District Magistrate also seems to have treated it as an incompetent application, as he declined jurisdiction under
Section 435
, Criminal Procedure Code, and refused to call for the records on the ground that the police were the proper parties to apply and not prosecution witness No. 1. This case is therefore clearly distinguishable from the case quoted. Neither the application, nor the order of the District Magistrate who refused to entertain it and to consider it on the merits, can thus be properly treated in our opinion as a bar to the action taken suo motu by the Sessions Judge in this case.
We may observe that, if we considered that there was any difficulty in upholding the Sessions Judge's order, we should have ourselves given notice to the accused and directed his committal to the Sessions under our revisional powers, if we considered it necessary in the ends of justice to do so, as the objection taken cannot apply in any case to our exercise of the powers vested in us. But, as the objection to the Sessions Judge's order so far as it refers to Section 304, Indian Penal Code, fails, it is not necessary to do so.
6. On the merits, there seems to be good reason for directing a trial of this accused in the Sessions Court. Both the Deputy Magistrate, to whom the case of the other accused was sent up for enhanced punishment by the Sub-Magistrate, and the Sessions Judge consider that the way in which the Sub-Magistrate dealt with the case was quite improper. There was a considerable body of evidence against this accused, and the Sub-Magistrate should have properly committed him to the Sessions, and not taken upon himself to discredit the case against him, on the ground of alibi, by giving him "the benefit of the doubt," as he did.
7. The order of committal by the Sessions Judge will therefore be confirmed, subject to Section 147, Indian Penal Code, being struck out of it.

                     Dated this the 1st day of August, 2007


                                        ORDER
Application for  anticipatory  bail.   The petitioner, a woman was


allegedly found   in possession of   12 litres of wash on 21.02.05.   The


alleged  recovery   was   from   the   personal   possession   of  the   petitioner.


The   seizure   mahazar   and   occurrence   report   show   the   name   of   the


petitioner   as   the   accused.     As   there   was   no   woman   officials   in   the


detecting party the petitioner could not be arrested.    Investigation  is


complete.  Final report has already been filed.   The petitioner has not


been   arrested.   The   petitioner   apprehends   imminent   arrest.   After


cognizance   was   taken,   the   learned   Magistrate   has   issued   coercive


processes against the petitioner. It is prayed that anticipatory bail may


be   granted   to   the   petitioner.       In   these   circumstances,   appropriate


directions may be issued under
section 438
Cr.P.C, prays the learned


counsel for the petitioner.
2.       After   the   decision   in
Bharat   Chaudhary   v.   State   of


Bihar
[A.I.R 2003 S.C 4662], it is trite that powers under
Section 438
Cr.P.C can be invoked in favour of a person who apprehends arrest in


execution   of   a   non   bailable   warrant   issued   by   a   court   in   a   pending


proceedings.     But   even   for   that,   sufficient   and   satisfactory   reasons
B.A.No.4649 of 2007                       2
must   be   shown   to   exist.     I   am   not   persuaded   in   the   facts   and


circumstances of this case to conclude that any such reasons exist.
3.     In the facts and circumstances of the case, I find absolutely


no   features   which   would   justify   the   invocation   of   the   extraordinary


equitable discretion under
Section 438
Cr.P.C. This is a fit case where


the   petitioner   must   appear   before   the   learned   Magistrate   or   the


Investigating Officer and seek regular bail in the normal and ordinary


course.
4.     This   application   is,   in   these   circumstances,   dismissed.     I


may hasten to observe that if the petitioner appears before the learned


Magistrate and applies for bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the


Prosecutor in charge of the case, the learned Magistrate must proceed


to pass appropriate orders on merits and expeditiously - on the date of


surrender   itself,   unless   there   are   compelling   reasons.       Needless   to


say,   the   learned   Magistrate   has   to   take   into   account   all   the


circumstances  including the  fact that   the  petitioner   is   a  woman,  that


the   investigation   is   already   complete   and   that   petitioner   though


available for arrest had not been arrested earlier.

ORDER
The Court
1. The petitioner/management has challenged in this writ petition the order of the Labour Court, Mysore, in I.D. No. 50 of 1993 holding that the respondent/claimant is entitled to retire from service with effect from 24-1-1995 and award of consequential benefits on the basis of the said date of retirement.
2. Brief facts of the case are as hereunder:
The petitioner is a company manufacturing sugar. The respondent was appointed as mason in the year 1951. While joining the company he did not furnish his date of birth. Subsequently, he was working in the company as a driver. As no documentary proof of date of birth was given by him to indicate his age, the petitioner constituted Medical Board for examining the respondent and similarly placed employees who have not given the date of birth or age at the time of entering into service. The respondent was called upon to appear before the Medical Board. The respondent appeared before the Medical Board. He was examined and the Medical Board gave its report stating that the age of the respondent was 30 years as on 18-2-1962. On the basis of the said report the age of the respondent was entered as 30 years in the service register. The said fact was brought to the notice of the respondent and he has given his consent for fixing his date of birth as 18-2-1932 and he also signed the service register giving his consent for all the particulars indicated in the service record. In the year 1983 the petitioner published a gradation list giving details regarding date of birth, entering into service, designation etc. In the said gradation list the date of birth of the respondent was shown as 18-2-1932. At that point of time the respondent submitted a representation dated 26-9-1983 objecting to the entry of his date of birth in the service register as 24-1-1935 and requested to enter his date of birth as 24-1-1935 and  in support of his contention he enclosed a copy of the  school transfer certificate issued by the Government Middle School.
However, he did not pursue the matter thereafter. In the petitioner/company the age of superannuation was 60 years. Accordingly, the respondent attained the age of superannuation on 18-2-1992. However, by oversight the petitioner did not retire the respondent from service of the company on 18-2-1992. It is only on 2-3-1993 a memo of retirement was served on the respondent wherein it was clearly indicated that though the respondent had attained the age of superannuation on 18-2-1992 itself the management did not retire him from service by oversight. Therefore, it was intimated to him that his retirement comes into effect from 2-3-1993. Thereafter the respondent filed a civil suit O.S. No. 277 of 1993 on 3-3-1993 before the Munsiff's Court, Mandya, seeking a decree restraining the management from giving effect to the memo dated 2-3-1993. Further the respondent also sought an interim order of temporary injunction. However, on 10-3-1993 the respondent has withdrawn the suit stating that he would not press the same and accordingly the suit came to be dismissed. It is thereafter the respondent gave a representation dated 8-3-1993 stating that he has served the company for 40 years and since he has been retired from the company on 2-3-1993 he requested the management to settle the gratuity payable to him at the earliest which claim has been paid. It is after settlement of the accounts the respondent filed an application under Section 10(4-
A) of the Industrial Disputes (Karnataka Amendment) Act, 1987
, before the Labour Court at Mysore with a prayer to pass an award holding that the retirement of the respondent on 2-3-1993 is premature and therefore he sought for reinstatement as driver retrospectively from 2-3-1993 with continuity of service, full back wages and other consequential benefits.
3. The petitioner opposed the said application by filing a detailed statement of objections. Thereafter an enquiry was held. The respondent examined himself as WW-1 and one witness was examined on behalf of the petitioner as MW-1 and documents were produced on either side in support of the respective claims. The Labour Court on the oral and documentary evidence on record held that the medical certificate issued by the Medical Board regarding the age of the respondent cannot be relied upon and in that connection he relied on a judgment in the case of Anima Saha v Steel Authority of India Limited and Others. Acting on the transfer certificate relied on by the respondent, the Labour Court held that the date of birth of the respondent is 24-1-1935 and therefore his termination before the age of superannuation on 2-3-1993 is illegal. Therefore, the Labour Court held that the petitioner/management was not justified in retiring the claimant with effect from 2-3-1993. As the respondent had already attained the age of superannuation on the date of the impugned award the Labour Court declined to grant the relief of reinstatement but held the respondent is entitled for back wages for the period from 2-3-1993 to 24-1-1995. It is against the said award of the Labour Court the management has preferred this writ petition.
4. Sri B.C. Prabhakar, learned Counsel for the petitioner contended before me, the Labour Court was in total error in rejecting the report of
the Medical Board and in relying on a transfer certificate produced by the respondent for the first time in the year 1983. He submitted, if really the said transfer certificate was available it was open to the respondent to have produced the same either at the time of joining the service or at the time when he was called upon to appear before the Medical Board for examination to determine his age. He further submitted that the respondent not only did not object to the medical examination but he did not dispute the finding of the Medical Board regarding his age and on the contrary he has signed the service register accepting the correctness of the date of birth given by the Medical Board. It is only when the gradation list was published in the year 1983 for the first time, he raised the objection by filing a representation. However, he did not pursue the matter for nearly a period of ten years thereafter. It is only after the service of the order of termination on superannuation which was served on him he has raised the dispute regarding the age and date of birth. Therefore, he submits in view of the settled legal position the Labour Court committed serious error in ignoring the medical report and in acting on the transfer certificate which was produced for the first time in the year 1983 and therefore he submits the impugned award of the Labour Court is liable to be set aside.
6. Sri Leelakrishnan, learned Counsel for the respondent submitted, when there is documentary proof of age and date of birth the medical report would have no value. He further submitted that before a medical report could be acted upon that report should be based on ossification test and also radiological examination and in the absence of sucb test being conducted the medical report or medical opinion has no value in the eye of law. He also submitted, as initially the petitioner was appointed in Sathanur Farm he was employed only at the age of 15 years and therefore the finding of the Medical Board is incorrect and cannot be made basis for determining the date of birth of the respondent. When the Labour Court on proper appreciation of the oral and documentary evidence has recorded a finding that the medical report cannot be accepted, whereas the date of birth in the transfer certificate is acceptable, this Court in its jurisdiction under
Article 226
could not interfere with the said finding of fact and therefore he submits a case for interference is not made out.
6. In view of the aforesaid facts and rival contentions, what emerges is this:
It is not in dispute that the respondent joined the service of the petitioner in the year 1951. At the time of joining the service he has not given his date of birth. No reasons are forthcoming for not giving his date of birth at the time of joining the service. If really he has studied in the school and he was in possession of a transfer certificate, no reasons are given for not producing the same before the management. It is only in the absence of proof of age of the respondent the petitioner has constituted a Medical Board not only to examine the respondent, but to determine the age of the persons who are similarly placed as that of the respondent. Before the respondent was called upon to appear before the
Medical Board it was made clear to him the reason why he has to appear before the Medical Board. If really, the respondent had no doubt about his date of birth and he has studied in the Government school and he was in possession of the transfer certificate which he now relies on, on the face of it appears to have been issued in the year 1956 six years prior to the date of the medical examination it was open to him to produce the said certificate and contend before the petitioner that there was no necessity for his examination to decide his probable age. On the contrary he submitted himself for the medical examination and when it was made known to him that his probable date of birth is 18-2-1932 accepting the same he has signed his service register in token of acceptance of the said date of birth. Nearly 11 years thereafter he did not raise any objection to such entry being made in the service register. It is only in the year 1983 when the petitioner published a gradation list showing his date of birth as 18-2-1932, for the first time he raised his objections to the same by submitting a representation and enclosing along with the representation the transfer certificate. However, thereafter he did not bother to find out what happened to his representation, whether the petitioner has accepted his objection and whether any corrections have been made in the service register. It is only on 2-3-1993 when he has been served with a communication informing him that as he superannuated on 29-2-1992 itself he should have been retired, but by mistake he has been continuing in service, however, he is retired from service on 2-3-1993, nearly one year after the actual age of superannuation, he made an unsuccessful attempt to challenge the entry of date of birth in the service register by filing a suit. Probably as no interim order was granted in the said suit he withdrew the suit, made a request to the petitioner to settle his gratuity amount and other service benefits and after collecting all the amounts he has raised the present industrial dispute contending that his date of birth is 18-2-1935 and not 18-2-1932.
7. Therefore, the only question that would arise for consideration is, in the light of the aforesaid facts, whether the Labour Court was justified in accepting his contention that his date of birth is 18-2-1935 and not 18-2-1932 as opined by the Medical Board.
8. The Court below has rejected the opinion of the Medical Board relying on the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Anima Saha, supra. In the aforesaid judgment the workman at the time of joining service declared her date of birth as 30th September, 1935. In support of her contention she has enclosed an affidavit affirmed by her uncle declaring her date of birth as her parents were dead at that time. She had also passed matriculation examination in the University of Calcutta in 1939 and she has enclosed the matriculation certificate which did not show her date of birth. The column meant for age having been left blank she had to give an affidavit When she made proposal for her life insurance policy she wanted her date of birth to be certified by her employer. It is in that connection her employer called upon her to appear before the Medical Board to show her date of birth/age. She made a representation stating that she would appear before the Medical Board as an obedient employee but any difference with her deviation from
the date of birth declared by her and supported by affidavit would not be acceptable to her. The Medical Board on examination gave her age as 42 years 6 months on 3rd March, 1977, accordingly her date of birth had been recorded as falling on 3rd September, 1934 whereas she gave the date of birth as 30th September, 1935, a difference of one year. It is in that context that her date of birth was altered according to the medical report. The question arose, how far the authority concerned would be justified in superseding the declaration of the petitioner about her age made at the time of her entry in the service, on the basis of medical report subsequently obtained. It is in that context it is held that without any fear of contradiction that the medical opinion about the age of a person, more so in the case of adults, can never be certain to the extent of telling the exact age of a person on a particular date. On the basis of physical features and factors such as teeth, height, weight etc., even if it is possible for medical experts to make an approximate assessment about the age of an adult, such assessment can never pronounce the exact age on any particular date. But it is generally accepted that a more reliable assessment about age can be made by conducting ossification test. It is however the contention of the petitioner that in her case no ossification test was made. Therefore, having regard to the facts of that case, the Court held that as the difference between the age opined by the medical assessment and the age declared by the petitioner and affirmed in the affidavit was only one year which falls within the range of the acknowledged possibility of variation of the age calibrated by medical opinion, the age declared by the Medical Board was not acceptable.
9. In the instant case the respondent had not given his date of birth at the time of joining service, he did not give his date of birth even at the time of medical examination. After medical examination he did not challenge the correctness of the same. On the contrary he accepted the correctness of the said report by signing the service register. Now the difference in age given by him and the Medical Board is roughly three years. Under these circumstances, the Court below was in total error in wrongly applying the law laid down in the aforesaid judgment to the facts of this case and rejecting the medical opinion given by the Medical Board.
10. The learned Counsel for the petitioner relied on a judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of
Bharat Coking Coal Limited v. Presiding Officer and Anr.
where it has been held:
"The Industrial Tribunal was not justified in setting aside the medical opinion regarding the age of the workman determined by the Medical Board constituted by the management. No objection was raised before the Tribunal regarding the competency of the doctors constituting the Medical Board. The medical examination of the Civil Surgeon could not be any different than that of the Medical Board constituted by the management. The findings of
the Tribunal was based on surmises and conjectures. In fact the workman did not challenge the opinion of the Medical Board constituted by the management, which determined the age of workman as 58 years and on that basis the workman was retained in service for 2 more years. Hence the dispute raised by the workman after retirement is unjustified".
He also relied on the judgment of the Calcutta High Court in the case of
Fateh Alam Khan v Tea Trading Corporation of India and Others
, wherein it has been held as under:
"The respondents acted upon the medical examination report for determining the age of the petitioner while the petitioner relied upon the purported School Leaving Certificate. It was incumbent upon the respondents to ascertain the date of birth of the petitioner for his service purposes and they preferred to act upon the medical examination report which was there in the record from the very time of joining of the petitioner in service. It cannot be said that respondents acted arbitrarily or mala fide in determining the date of birth of the petitioner on the basis of the medical examination report. The materials on records are not of such clear nature as can lead the Court to any clear conclusion that the purported School Leaving Certificate can be or ought to have been accepted as on unimpeachable piece of evidence on the point. It cannot be said that the respondents acted arbitrarily or mala fide in refusing to act upon the School Leaving Certificate".
The Supreme Court in the case of
Jaya Mala v Home Secretary, Government of Jammu and Kashmir and Others
, dealing with a medical report has held as under:
"However, it is notorious and one can take judicial notice that the margin of error in age ascertained by radiological examination is two years on either side".
11. Therefore, in view of the aforesaid legal position the opinion of the Medical Board cannot be so lightly rejected. Only in a case where an entry is made in the service register based on the date furnished by the workman or based on the school records, if such date is to be altered on the basis of the opinion of the Medical Board the said report has to be scrutinised carefully to find out whether the said opinion is based on ossification test and radiological examination and that too when the difference between the two dates is more than two years. But in a case where at the time of joining duty no date of birth was given by the employee and when he was called upon to appear before the Medical Board, he appears without any protest and has not challenged the report and on the contrary has accepted it, he cannot be permitted to challenge the said opinion at the fag end of his career that too before retirement. If the date of birth as entered in the service register has remained for
considerably long period without any protest that cannot be altered at the fag end of the career of the employee just before retirement or after retirement.
12. In the instant case, the respondent has chosen to challenge this entry after retirement. In fact, on the basis of the said medical report the petitioner ought to have been retired one year prior to the actual date of retirement. By mistake committed by the management he had the benefit of one extra year of service and it is thereafter he is trying to challenge the date of birth in the service register. Even if the theory of allowing one year either side is applied to the facts of this case, the respondent has been retired one year after the said date of birth given by the Medical Board. When the medical examination was conducted in 1962, nearly after 30 years in 1993, the management cannot be expected to produce the records to show that ossification test was conducted at that time, and on that basis his age was determined, when immediately after the medical examination the same was not challenged on that ground and on the contrary the age determination was accepted. The Labour Court was in total error in rejecting the report of the Medical Board and accepting the entry in the transfer certificate and awarding payment of back wages from the date of his retirement till the date of his superannuation as contended by him. Therefore, I am of the opinion the impugned order passed by the labour Court cannot be sustained and accordingly it is set aside. Hence I pass the following order:
13.  Rule made absolute. Writ petition is allowed. Parties to bear their own costs.

admitted, on behalf of the respondent, by filing an affidavit of Mr.
B.L.Desai, Police Sub-Inspector, DCB Police Station, Surat, and that
it is at page No. 83 onwards. However, perusing the record of the

Punjab-Haryana High Court
Mohinder Kaur vs Rani And Ors. on 17 November, 1983
Equivalent citations: 1(1984)ACC406
JUDGMENT
 

 S.S. Sodhi, J.
1. Mewa Ram, deceased was killed in an accident when the car in which he was travelling hit against a truck parked on the road side. The Tribunal, holding that the accident here had been caused by the rash and negligent driving of the car driver, awarded a sum of Rs. 60,000/- as compensation to the claimants, they being the parents, widow and children of deceased. Included in the amount awarded was a sum of Rs. 4000/- awarded to the parents and Rs. 8000/-to the widow and children of the deceased for loss of love and affection on account of the death of the deceased. The challenge in the appeal filed by the owner of the car, involved in the accident, was to this post of the award of compensation to the claimants.
2. It is now settled by the Full Bench of this Court in
Lachhman Singh v. Gurmit Kaur
1979 P.L.R. 1, that no amount can be awarded for loss of love and affection and there is consequently no escape from the conclusion that the Tribunal erred in awarding this sum of Rs. 12,000/- as compensation to the claimants.
3. Mr. J.S. Chahal, counsel for the Insurance Company, in the other appeal, sought to raise the contention that the liability of the Insurance Company for the amount awarded as compensation in this case was limited to Rs. 10,000/-. He adverted in this behalf to the provisions of
Section 95
of the Motor Vehicles Act.
4. In dealing with this contention, it must be noted that no plea was raised by the Insurance Company before the Tribunal with regard to there being any limit to its liability. No such point was at any time urged even before the Tribunal and now even the grounds of appeal this point has not been specifically taken. In these circumstances it would clearly be contrary to the interests of justice to allow this point to be raised for the first time in appeal.
5. In the result the appeals filed by the Insurance Company as also the car owner, are accepted to the extent that the amount awarded is reduced to Rs. 48,000/-. As a consequence out of the amount awarded, a sum of Rs. 2500/- each shall be paid to the parents of the deceased, Rs. 3000/- each to his minor children and the balance to his widow. There will be no order as to costs.

Orissa High Court
M.P. Swami vs Mangaram Agarwalla on 17 July, 1978
Equivalent citations: AIR1979ORI11, AIR 1979 ORISSA 11, (1978) 46 CUT LT 197
JUDGMENT
 

P.K. Mohanti, J.
1. The second appeal is by the defendant against a decree of affirmance arising out of a suit for ejectment   and   for  recovery of    arrears    of house rent.
2. The plaintiff's case was that the suit house was let out to the defendant in the month of July, 1968 on a monthly rent of Rs. 15, but the defendant failed to pay the rent from May, 1972 despite repeated requests and did not vacate the house despite service of notice under
Section 106
of the Transfer of Property Act determining the tenancy with effect from 31st October, 1973.
3.   The defendant disputed  the  plaintiff's title to the suit  house   and denied that he  was  a monthly     tenant    under the plaintiff in respect of the same.
4. The learned Munsif decreed the suit holding that the plaintiff was the owner of the suit house, that the defendant was a monthly tenant in respect of the same, that he was in arrears of house rent from May, 1972 and that the notice under
Section 106
of the Transfer of Property Act terminating the tenancy with effect from 31st October, 1973 was duly served on the defendant.
5. Before the first appellate court the defendant did not challenge the finding of the trial court that he was a monthly tenant under the plaintiff in respect of the suit premises, but contended that the notice under
Section 106
of the Transfer of Property Act was not served on him. The learned Addl. District Judge on a consideration of the evidence on the record came to the findings that the defendant had refused to accept the notice under
Section 106
of the Transfer of Property Act and that he had not vacated the house despite termination of the tenancy. Accordingly he confirmed the decree passed by the trial court. The findings of the lower appellate court are assailed in this appeal.
6. According to the plaintiff, the notice (Ext. 1) was sent to the defendant by registered post and he had refused to accept the same as per the endorsement of refusal made by the postal peon on the registered cover. The defendant made statement on oath that the postal envelope containing the notice was not tendered to him and the allegation that he refused to accept the same is false. The lower appellate court came to the conclusion that the presumption arising out of
Section 114
of the Indian Evidence Act had not been rebutted by the defendant.
It is urged in this appeal that the endorsement of refusal by the postal peon could not be taken into consideration unless the postman was examined.
7. According to
Section 114
of the Evidence Act the Court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case. The Court may thus presume that the common course of business or of any office has been followed in the particular case. Where a notice sent by post in a registered cover is returned by the postman with the endorsement that the addressee refused to receive it, and the posting of the notice has been proved, there arises a presumption under
Section 114
, Evidence Act that the addressee did refuse to receive it even though the postman has not been produced to prove tender and refusal. Undoubtedly the presumption is one of fact and rebuttable. It can never be regarded as conclusive. The presumption is not rebutted by denial on oath by the addressee unless it is believed by the Court. I am fortified in this view by two decisions of the Supreme Court reported in AIR 1963 SC 822 (
Radha Kishan v. State of Uttar Pradesh
) and AIR 1976 SC 869 (
Puwada Venkateswara Rao v. Chidamana Venkata Ramana
). In the latter case the Supreme Court held (at p. 871):--
".....  It is not   always    necessary    in such cases, to produce the postman who tried to effect service. The denial of service by a party may be found to be incorrect from its own admissions or conduct....."
8. In the present case, the statement of the defendant in court that the notice was not tendered to him has not been believed by the lower appellate court. Taking into consideration the conduct of the defendant and several circumstances appearing against him it came to hold as follows:--
".....  These   are the     circumstances, which are against the appellant, who cannot be taken to have rebutted the presumption available to the plaintiff, under
Section 114
of the Evidence Act, to the effect that the notice, Ext. 1 was offered to the defendant, but was refused by him,"
I see no cogent ground to interfere with the above finding of the lower appellate Court.
9. There is no merit in this appeal and it is accordingly dismissed with costs.

Punjab-Haryana High Court

CWP No.631 of 2009                                   :1:

      In the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh.


                                             Date of decision:21.07.2009



Sukhjeet Kaur Vs. Punjab School Education Board, through its
                  Secretary.


Present:    Mr.Arvind Singh, Advocate.
            Mr.PP Singh, Advocate.
            --

PERMOD KOHLI, J. (Oral):
The petitioner applied for correction of his date of birth to

respondent-Board vide his application dated 10.12.2008, Annexure P-6

giving details of the circumstances for the change of date of birth from

05.02.1973 to 02.10.1974 in the Matriculation Certificate issued by the

respondent-Board. The petitioner produced matriculation certificate as also

the date of birth certificate issued by the Additional Distt. Registrar, Births

and Deaths, Moga.
The grievance of the petitioner is that        his application for

correction in his date of birth has not been decided till date. The petitioner

has accordingly, filed this petition seeking a direction in the nature of

mandamus to decide his application for correction of date of birth.
In the reply filed by the respondents, it is stated that the

application of the petitioner for correction of date of birth is beyond the

required period of two years. It is also stated that such applications could

be filed within a period of two years and by seeking condonation of delay,

the same can be filed within a period of five years. The fact remains that

respondents have not passed any order rejecting or accepting the application
CWP No.631 of 2009                                  :2:
of the petitioner for correction of change of date of birth. It is obligatory

upon the respondents to decide the application for correction of change of

date of birth.    However, the respondents have failed to discharge their

obligations.
In view of the above, this petition is disposed of with a

direction to the respondent-Board to take a decision on the application of

the petitioner dated 10.12.2008, Annexure P-6, within a period of two

months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order. The

respondents while deciding the application will take into consideration all

the circumstances referred to here-in-above and pass consequential order.

Needless to say, in the event the claim of the petitioner is to be rejected, it

shall by a speaking and reasoned order.

           Dated this the 18th day of January, 2011

                           JUDGMENT
The petitioner defaulted repayment of loan amounts due

from him to the respondent bank who has initiated proceedings

under the
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets

and Enforcement of Security Interest Act
for recovery of the

same. The petitioner does not dispute the liability to pay or the

quantum.     He only seeks facility to pay off the amounts in

instalments.
2.   I have heard the learned Standing Counsel for the

bank, who opposes the prayers.
3.   Having heard both sides, I dispose of this writ petition

with the following directions:
The petitioner shall pay an amount of Rs.3 lakhs within one

month from today. The balance amount shall be paid in six equal

monthly instalments starting from 1.4.2011. Every subsequent

instalment shall be paid on the first working day of every
W.P.(C)No.1653/11               2
succeeding month. If the petitioner complies with the above

directions promptly, further proceedings pursuant to the

impugned proceedings shall be kept in abeyance. However, if

the petitioner fails to pay either Rs.3 lakhs or any of the

subsequent instalments, it would be open to the respondents

to continue proceedings as now initiated without having to

issue any fresh notice or proceedings in that regard.

Delhi High Court
Krishan Lal vs Ajit Pershad Jain And Ors. on 2 November, 1987
Equivalent citations: 35(1988)DLT107
JUDGMENT  

Sunanda Bhandare, J.
(1) ADMIT.
(2) Since a very short point is involved in the petition I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and proceed to decide the petition itself.
(3) This petition under
Article 227
of the Constitution of India is directed against the order of the Additional Rent Controller, Delhi dated 6th October 1987. The Additional Rent Controller, Delhi pursuant to the orders of this Court gave one final opportunity to the petitioner herein to adduce his evidence. However, on the date fixed, one witness namely Shri Mam Raj was present, but the lawyer of the petitioner was stated to be out of station and, therefore, a prayer for adjournment was made. The Additional Rent Controller, Delhi did not accede to this request because this Court had specifically directed that one last final opportunity be given to the petitioner to adduce his evidence. In that sense the Additional Rent Controller was helpless because he was bound to follow and obey the order of this Court. Ordinirily, this Court would not have interfered in this petition under
Article 227
of the Constitution of India because there is no apparent error in the order of the Additional Rent Controller, however considering that one witness was present on the date fixed for the evidence of the petitioner, I think that interest of justice requires that one more opportunity should be given to the petitioner to examine the witness who was present on that date. This is because on the date fixed the petitioner could not examine this witness because the advocate was absent and the party Should not suffer because of the lapse of the advocate   

 (4) I, therefore, direct the Additional Rent Controller, Delhi to permit the petitioner to examine only one witness namely Shri Mam Raj who was stated to be present on the date already fixed. This witness will however be produced by the petitioner himself at his own responsibility without getting any orders regarding summons for that purpose. The case is already listed before the Additional Rent Controller, Delhi on 19th November 1987. This witness will be examined on that date and the arguments in the case will also proceed on that date if the Additional Rent Controller, Delhi finds it so convenient.

             Dated this the 7th day of December, 2010.

                                 JUDGMENT
In this writ petition the petitioner seeks for a direction to the Sub

Inspector of Police to see that the injunction order granted by the Civil

Court as per Ext.P2 is obeyed by respondents 3 to 5.
2. The petitioner has filed the suit O.S. No.29/2010 before the Sub

Court, Payyannur seeking for various reliefs. Ext.P2 is the copy of the

order of interim injunction granted by the civil court               restraining the

defendants in the suit from conducting the quarrying operation by use of

explosives and without proper licence. It is the case of the petitioner that in

violation of the direction issued by the civil court, respondents 3 to 5

continued the illegal quarrying operation which compelled the petitioner to

approach the police by filing Ext.P3 representation. It is averred in the writ

petition that the police is not taking any action in the matter.
3.   Heard learned counsel appearing for respondents 3 to 5 and

learned counsel for the Panchayat.
4. The counter affidavit filed by respondents 3 to 5 reveals that two

other civil suits, viz.. O.S. Nos. 452/2006 and 564/2009 are pending before
wpc 13997/2010                         2
the Munsiff's Court, Thaliparamba for the same relief. The latter one is

filed by the father as well as wife of the petitioner. It is the case of the

respondents that suppressing the pendency of these two civil suits, the

petitioner filed the present suit.     Learned counsel for the petitioner

submitted that the petitioner was not aware about the pendency of the other

suits.
5. The contesting respondents have filed Ext.R3(d) application to

vacate the interim order of injunction. It is also their case that they are not

violating the injunction order and are not using explosives.      But they are

extracting   rock only by use of man power.         Learned counsel for the

Panchayat submitted that the Panchayat has not issued any licence for

quarrying.
6. Evidently, there is dispute between the parties as to whether there

is use of explosives or not. Apart from that, the police cannot be an arbiter

in the civil disputes.   If the petitioner wants assistance of the police for

enforcement of the order of injunction, he could have approached the civil

court by invoking the remedy under Rule 151 C.P.C.           For the alleged

violation of the injunction order also, the petitioner has got a remedy under

Order 39 Rule 2A of the C.P.C.
7. In that view of the matter, this Court, at this stage, will not be
wpc 13997/2010                        3
justified in issuing a direction, especially as the order issued is only an

exparte order and the contesting respondents have already filed an

application to vacate the injunction order. It is made clear that the parties

can approach the civil court itself for adjudication of their disputes and the

writ petition is disposed of accordingly. No costs.
(T.R. Ramachandran Nair, Judge.)

Karnataka High Court
Raghunath Balakrishna Deshpande vs Biharilal Krishnaprasad Dave on 16 July, 1971
Equivalent citations: AIR1972KANT159, AIR1972MYS159, AIR 1972 MYSORE 159
ORDER 


 

  V.S. Malimath, J.
1. This is a defendant's revision petition against the Order passed by the Munsif of Belgaum in R. O. S. No. 442/1968 wherein he recorded his findings on the preliminary issues to the effect that the suit document is a promissory note and not a money bond and that it is admissible in evidence as the said document is duly stamped as a promissory note.
2. Shri. W. K. Joshi. the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the learned Munsiif committed an error in holding that the suit document is a promissory note and not a money bond. It is not disputed that if the document is a money bond, the same is not duly stamped. It is also not disputed that if the suit document is construed as a promissory note, it is duly stamped and admissible in evidence. The only question for consideration, therefore, is as to whether the suit document is a promissory note as contended by the plaintiff or a money bond as contended by the defendant,
3. The expression 'promissory note' has been defined in
Section 2(22)
of the Indian Stamp Act as follows:
"2 (22) "Promissory note" means a promissory note as defined by the
Negotiable Instruments Act
. 1881; it also includes a note promissing the payment of any sum of money out of any particular fund which may or may not be available or upon any condition or contingency which may or may not be performed or happen."
The expression 'bond' has been defined in
Section 2(5)
of the Indian Stamp Act as follows:
"2  (5) "bond includes-
(a) any instrument whereby a person obliges himself to pay money to another, on condition that the obligation 
shall be void if a specified act is performed, or is not performed, as the case may be;
(b) any instrument attested by a witness and not payable to order or bearer, whereby a person obliges him-self to pay money to another; and
(c) any instrument so attested, whereby a person obliges himself to deliver grain or other agricultural produce to another."
As the promissory note has been defined in
Section 2(22)
of the Indian Stamp Act as meaning a promissory note as defined in the
Negotiable Instruments Act
it is necessary to advert to the relevant provisions of the
Negotiable Instruments Act
. The expression 'promissory note' has not been defined in any definition section or in
Section 3
pertaining to the interpretation clause. We, however, find the definition of the expression 'promissory note' in
Chapter II of the Negotiable Instruments Act
under the Head "of notes bills and cheques."
Section 4
of the Negotiable Instruments Act reads as follows:--
"4. A "promissory note" is an instruments in writing (not being a bank note or a currency note) containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker, to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person, or to the bearer of the instrument."
Another relevant provision to be noticed in this connection is
Section 13
which is also contained in Chapter II.
Section 13
reads as follows:--
"13. (1) A "negotiable instrument" means a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer. 
   

 Explanation (i):-- A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is payable to order which is expressed to be so payable or which is expressed to be payable to particular person, and does not contain words prohibiting transfer or indicating an intention that it shall not be transferable. 
 

 Explanation (ii):-- A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque is payable to bearer which is expressed to be so payable or on which the only or last endorsement is an endorsement in blank. 
 

 Explanation (iii):-- Where a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque, either originally or by indorsement, is expressed to be payable to the order of a specified person, and not to him or his order it is nevertheless payable to him or his order at his option.  
 

 (2) A negotiable instrument may be made payable to two or more payees jointly, or it may be made payable in the alternative to one of two, one or some of several payees."
The document in question reads    as
follows: 
   

Belgaum. 21-12-1965. 
 

 To,
Shri Biharilal Krishna Prasad Dave, Age 30 year, occupation Doctor, Religion Hindu, This day at Belgaum.
I Raghunath Balkrishna Deshpande Age 47. caste Hindu, profession business of Angol, this day at Belgaum. promised to pay you on demand the sum of Rs. 7,000/- (Seven Thousand) received cash this day as Hand loan without interest as the sum was needed by me for my personal need. I have taken the amount from you.
Sd/- R. B. Deshpande.
Witness:
(1) R.   H.   Deshpande.   Advocate,   and  
 

 (2) G. S. Adhyapak".
It is clear from the recitals in the document that there is an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker, to pay a certain sum of money, viz.. Rs. 7,000/-only to Shri Biharilal Krishna Prasad Dave. The document will be a promissory note if it fulfils the following conditions specified in
Section 4
:
(1) It must be in writing and signed by the maker;
(2) It should not be a bank note or a currency note;
(3) It must contain an unconditional promise to pay a sum certain in money only;
(4) It   must   be   payable   on   demand or at a fixed or determinable future time; (5) It must be payable (i) to a specified person; (ii) or  to  the  order  of  a  specified person;
(iii) or to the bearer of the instrument.
It is not disputed that the first four conditions are fulfilled in this case. There cannot be any doubt that the 5th condition is also satisfied, inasmuch as the amount is payable to the person specified in the document itself. I find it difficult to accede to the contention of Shri W. K. Joshi. the learned counsel for the petitioner that the document in question is not a promissory note because of the absence of the words in the document making it negotiable. It is necessary to note that the 5th condition requires that the amount must, be payable to a specified person or to the order of a specified person or to the bearer. It is, therefore, clear that even if there are no recitals in the document that the amount is payable to the order of a specified person or to the bearer, the document will still be a promissory note if the amount is payable to a specified person.
Shri W. K. Joshi's contention that if the amount is payable to a specified person, the document cannot become a promissory note stands clearly dislodged by illustration (b) to
Section 4
of the Negotiable Instruments Act which reads as follows:--
"A signs instruments in the following terms:--
(a) xx                xx                xx
(b) I acknowledge myself to be indebted to B in Rs. 1,000/- to be paid on demand, for value received."
(c) xx xx                  xx    
 

 The instruments  respectively marked 
 (a)     and   (b)   are  promissory  notes   ......"
Illustration (b) to
Section 4
clearly shows that the document is a promissory note if the amount is payable to a specified person notwithstanding the fact that there are no recitals to the effect that the amount is payable to the order of a specified person or to the bearer.
4. It was next urged by Shri Joshi that as the document is attested, the same is not a promissory note. It is no doubt true that a promissory note does not require attestation. At the same time, it is necessary to note that there is nothing in the
Negotiable Instruments Act
to indicate that an attestation of a document like the promissory note is prohibited. Attestation of a document as usually got done for the sake of abundant caution even though attestation is not the requirement of law. Merely because the document in question which is otherwise a promissory note, has been attested, it does not lose its character as a promissory note. I have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that the document in question is a promissory note.
5. Shri W. K. Joshi next submitted that though the document in question is a promissory note as denned in
Section 2(22)
of the Indian Stamp Act, the same also answers the definition of the expression 'bond' given in
Section 2(6)
of the said Act. Relying upon
Section 6
of the Indian Stamp Act. Shri Joshi submitted that if the document comes within two or more of the descriptions in Schedule I it shall be chargeable only with the highest of such duties where the duties chargeable thereunder are different. He submitted that if the document in question is a bond as defined in
Section 2(5)
of the Indian Stamp Act. it is chargeable with duty higher than a promissory note. As the necessary stamp has not been affixed as a money bond, he urged that the document is not duly stamped and that therefore the same is not admissible in evidence. It is not disputed that the document in question does not bear the requisite stamp as a bond. The question for consideration therefore is as to whether the document in question is a bond.
6. Shri W. K. Joshi submitted that the document in question is a bond as it answers the definition given in
Section 2(5)(b)
of the Stamp Act. Under
Section 2(5)(b)
, the following conditions have to be satisfied if the document is to be construed as a bond:
(i) that under the document an obligation is created to pay the money by the executant to another person;
(ii) that the document is attested by a witness; and
(iii) that the amount is not payable to order or bearer.
It is not disputed by both the parties that the first two conditions are satisfied. The controversy is on the question as to whether the third condition has been satisfied. As already noticed, there are no recitals in the document itself indicating that the amount is payable to order or bearer.
Section 13(1)
of the Negotiable Instruments Act defines a negotiable instrument as meaning a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to order or to bearer. Explanation (i) to the said Section states that a promissory note, bill of ax-change or cheque is payable to order which is expressed to be so payable or which is expressed to be payable to a particular person and does not contain words prohibiting transfer or indicating an intention that it shall not be transferable. I have already come to the conclusion that the document in question is a promissory note as defined in
Section 2(22)
of the Indian Stamp Act. A document which is a promissory note would be a negotiable instrument under
Section 13(1)
of the Negotiable Instruments Act if the amount is payable either to order or to bearer. But, in view of the latter part of Explanation (1) to
Section 13
of the Negotiable Instruments Act a promissory note shall be deemed to be payable to order if the amount is expressed to be payable to a particular person and does not contain words prohibiting transfer or indicating an intention that it shall not be transferable. Therefore the conditions mentioned in explanation (i) to
Section 13(1)
of the Negotiable Instruments Act are fulfilled. Therefore, the document in question is a negotiable instrument within the meaning of that expression under
Section 13
of the Act and the amount is in law, payable to order though there are no express words to that effect in the document itself. The amount under the document becomes legally payable to order by the operation of explanation (i) to
Section 13(i)
of the Negotiable Instruments Act. In other words, by the operation of law, the expression "payable to order" has to be read as having been Incorporated in
the document itself. All the legal consequences do follow on the basis that the amount is payable to order even though there is no express recital to that effect in the document. As under the document in question the amount in law is payable to order, it is clear that the third condition under
Section 2(5)
of the Stamp Act to which I have adverted to above is not satisfied. As the amount is payable to order under the document, the document does not answer the definition of the expression 'bond' given in
Section 2(5)(b)
of the Stamp Act. But, it was urged by Shri Joshi that though in law the amount is payable to order under the document in question, the document is still a bond as there are no recitals in the document itself expressly stating that the amount is payable to order.
7. Shri W K. Joshi. the learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance on the decision of the Patna High Court in , (Ram Narayan Bhagatt v. Ramachandra Singh. The documents dealt with by the Lordships of the Patna High Court were similar to the document under consideration in this case. In those two documents construed by the Patna High Court, the amount was payable to the specified respective creditors. The documents were attested. There were no recitals in these documents to show that the sums due are payable to order or bearer. On consideration of the several authorities placed before their Lordships, they came to the conclusion that those documents are bonds as defined in
Section 2(5)(b)
of the Stamp Act. Their Lordships took the view that as there are no specific recitals in the documents to the effect that the amounts are payable to order or bearer, the documents arc bonds under
Section 2(5)(b)
of the Stamp Act even though by the application of Explanation (i) to
Section 13(1)
of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the amounts due under these two documents are in law payable to order. With great respect. I find myself Unable to agree with the view taken in the said decision. There are no words in clause (5) of
Section 2
of the Stamp Act indicating that the non-payability of the amount to order should be expressed in the document itself. In my opinion, in view of explanation (i) to
Section 13(1)
the expression "payable to order" has fro be read as being part of the document as the document otherwise answers the definition of a promissory-note under
Section 4
of the Negotiable Instruments Act as well as under
Section 2(22)
of the Stamp Act. When the amount under the document in question is in law payable to order. I do not find any justification to proceed on the basis that the amount is not payable to order while
construing the document under the
Stamp Act
. In my opinion, the document must be construed even under the
Stamp Act
giving full effect to the legal consequences that flow as a result of the application of Explanation (i) to
Section 13(1)
of the Negotiable Instruments Act.
8. Shri Satya Murthv. the learned counsel for the respondent submitted that this is not a case in which
Section 6
of the Stamp Act can be invoked. He submitted that
Section 6
of the Indian Stamp Act can be invoked only in cases where the document answering both the descriptions under the same Act is liable to different Stamp duty. It was urged that if the document is a promissory-note, it will be governed by the
Indian Stamp Act
, whereas if the document is a bond the same will be governed by the Mysore Stamp Act. 1957. The definition of the expression 'bond' in
Section 2(5)
of the Indian Stamp Act is similar to the definition of the expression 'bond' given in Section 2 (1) (a) of the Mysore Stamp Act, 1957. As I have come to the conclusion that the document in question does not answer the definition of the expression 'bond' either under the
Indian Stamp Act
or under the Mysore Stamp Act. 'it is unnecessary to consider the contention urged by Shri Satya Murthy that there is no scope for invoking
Section 6
of the Indian Stamp Act.
9. For the reasons stated above, this revision petition fails and the same is dismissed. No costs.

Madras High Court
Kannappa Samiyar And Ors. vs The Madura Hindu Permanent Fund on 19 January, 1909
Equivalent citations: 1IND. CAS.909
JUDGMENT
1. We are unable to agree with the Commissioner and the District Judge as to the principle on which the accounts in this case should be taken. We think the monthly payments which have been made under Rule 2 of the Articles of Association of the Fund should be credited towards the mortgage loan. The 1st defendant when he became a member of the Society was under a contractual liability to pay Rs. 20 a month as the subscription on his shares. If he had incurred no liability by taking an advance on mortgage, he would, if ho paid Rs. 20 a month for 7 years, have been entitled to receive from the Society Rs. 2,050, the amounts of his subscriptions plus interest. When he took an advance on mortgage he covenanted by the mortgage deed to pay interest on the mortgage and also pay Rs. 20 a month. No doubt this Rs. 20 a month is described in the mortgage deed as the money which ho had agreed to pay under Rule 3, but the fact that he covenanted to pay this amount in the mortgage deed seems to us to indicate that the intention was, that these payments should be treated as payments on account of the mortgage. Otherwise there seems no object in inserting this covenant in the mortgage deed, since the subscriber was already under a contractual obligation to pay the Rs. 20 as a member of the society holding 20 shares. Further, this Rs. 20 a month is referred to in a later portion of the deed as instalments. This expression would be inappropriate if, according to the case for the respondents, these payments were not to be allocated pro tanto to the discharge of the mortgage debt.
2. We must, therefore, ask for a finding by the District Judge in accordance with the judgment as to the amount, if any, due under the mortgage.
3. The finding should be submitted within four months from this date. Ten days will be allowed for filing objections.
4. The second appeal coming on for final hearing after the return of the finding the Court delivered the following
 

Judgment
5. On the finding, which we accept, we dismiss the suit as against the 6th defendant and as against the property purchased by the 6th defendant with costs throughout. We modify the decree as against defendants Nos. 1 to 5 by adding Rs. 748-5-7 to the sum of Rs. 202-14-8 in Clause (b) of paragraph 3 of the District Judge's judgment. The defendants Nos. 1 to 5 must pay the plaintiff's costs in the Court of first instance. There will be no further order as to costs.

Calcutta High Court
Nishi Kanta Ghosh vs State Of West Bengal And Ors. on 11 March, 1993
Equivalent citations: (1993)1CALLT460(HC)
JUDGMENT
 

Ajoy Nath Ray, J.
1. This is an application where a permanent Teacher seeks to be permitted to resume duties of teaching.
2. The school involved is Gurguripal High School. It is not in dispute that the Writ petitioner was an Assistant Teacher and that the substantive appointment came sometime in early 1988.
The case of the Writ petitioner is that after obtaining due leave he Went to have B.Ed, training and that thereafter he was not permitted to join duties in the School.
3. The petitioner makes this case in the Writ petition that for the extraneous consideration of his alleged illicit relationship with one Sm. Janaki Ghose, of which he makes no admission, the School Authorities proceeded without jurisdiction and the District Inspector of Schools also apparently lent support to such proceeding by the Managing Committee on the basis of the said Sm. Janaki Ghose's involvement with the petitioner.
4. Mr. Samanta, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner, has submitted that a Teacher can be proceeded against by the Managing Committee of an educational institution in case and only in case of such breach of duties or other misconduct, which in some manner or the other, has some relationship with the discharge of duties as a Teacher in the school or the institution in question.
5. Mr. Samanta further submitted that in case of some alleged misconduct, which has no bearing whatsoever upon the teaching abilities or discharge of duties as a Teacher, the Managing Committee would be wrong to assume jurisdiction. In such case of, so to speak, extraneous misconduct, it would not be within the province of the Managing Committee either to suspend a Teacher from the post of a Teacher, or to dismiss him, and any approval by the District Inspector of Schools granted in this respect, would be equally without jurisdiction.
6. Mr. Samanta relies in this regard upon the case of Sk. Alauddin v. The District Inspector of Schools (S.E.), Midnapore, reported in 1987(1) CHN 327. Mr. Samanta said on the basis of the above authority that case shows an instance of such an extraneous factor being proceeded upon by the Authorities and there the extraneous factor was that of an inter-religious marriage.
7. I am of the opinion that Mr. Samanta is right in his submission and that the alleged affair of the petitioner with Sm. Janaki Ghose should not and could not have been made the subject matter of disciplinary proceeding by the Managing Committee of an educational institution. If the students of the School were benefiting or were likely to benefit from the discharge of teaching duties of the Writ petitioner, then that was all that the Managing Committee was or could be concerned with and it had no jurisdiction to enter into the private life of the Writ petitioner on some such basis as that of a moral inquisition.
8. The learned Advocate appearing for the Managing Committee, submitted that as stated in the eighth paragraph of the affidavit of the Managing Committee, the petitioner in fact was never stopped from attending his duties in School in or about 1990. The learned Advocate submitted, though the same is not in paragraph 8, that the petitioner did not attend his duties because he was to scared to attend the locality because of the rumours of his involvement with Sm. Janaki Ghose. Thus, it was said, that there was no suspension or any approval of suspension nor any prevention of the Writ petitioner from attending his duties, but that the Writ petitioner stayed away en his own.
9. Further and in the alternative, learned Advocate for the Managing Committee, relied upon the case of Baidyanath Bose and Ors. v. Sm. Sudha Roy and Ors., reported in 70 CWN 571 and placed paragraph 17 therefrom.
10. Regulation 3 of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education (Manner of Hearing and Deciding Appeals by Appeal Committee) Regulations, 1964, provides as follows:-
"3. A teacher or any other employee who feels to have been affected adversely by any decision of the Managing Committee of the Institution he serves or has served (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) may appeal direct to the Appeal Committee against such decision in accordance with the provisions of these regulations."
11. It was said that the appeal as provided in the above Regulation is the only remedy. It was said on the basis of the above authority in the case of Baidyanath Bose that a civil court is no substitute for the appellate authority and that though a civil court might award damages in a suit for improper action by the Managing Committee, yet the civil court cannot wield the power of the Appellate Authority and thus reverse the decision of the Managing Committee and direct reinstatement of the Teacher.
12. That might well be true, but we are involved not with the powers of an ordinary civil court, but a Writ Court which has powers of rectification and correction over all bodies and authorities, in case, these bodies or authorities exceed their jurisdiction, or act upon matters extraneous to their powers; then a Writ application would lie and the Court can grant appropriate reliefs in its discretion.
13. It is true that an appellate remedy often provides the defence of an alternative remedy which can be taken by a respondent to a Writ application. Existence of an alternative remedy has never been considered to be a complete bar to a Writ application. It is only a factor, one factor, amongst many others, to be taken into consideration by the Court while granting or refusing relief, although it is an important factor.
14. Here the question of alternative remedy is not so material, because the principal case of the School is not that by virtue of a decision of the Managing Committee the petitioner was excluded from joining his duties in 1990, but the case of the Committee is that the petitioner stayed away on his own.
15. There is no material on record for me to come to the conclusion that the petitioner stayed away being afraid to go to the locality and the petitioner has offered to join duties immediately if so permitted by appropriate compulsive orders being passed against the respondents.
16. In view of the above, I am of the opinion that the District Inspector of Schools, in Annexure T, did not and could vest the Managing Committee with jurisdiction to proceed against the Writ petitioner, if they themselves had none for proceeding against him on the allegations relating to Sm. Janaki Ghose. There is no case of any unauthorised leave, as the B.Ed, training was completed by the Writ petitioner after obtaining leave. As such, no show cause notice as against the Writ petitioner can survive as there exists no ground therefor upon which the same could be served or proceeded with.
17. The Writ application accordingly succeeds. There shall be a Rule absolute in terms of prayers (a), (b), (d), (e) and (g) of the petition with, however, the following modifications. On the basis of the above order the Writ petitioner shall join duties of the latest within eight weeks from date hereof and the Managing Committee of the School shall render all facilities to the petitioner for resumption of such duties. From the date of such joining the petitioner shall be paid monthly salary and allowances regularly month by month for a period of six months. The arrears that have been ordered to be paid shall, however, be paid to the petitioner after and only after the petitioner has rejoined duties and rendered services to the School for a period of six months after such rejoining. In case of completion of six months' service after rejoining as aforesaid, the arrears shall be paid to the petitioner within a period of twelve weeks from such completion. The arrears in that case must be paid, because in the above event there would be no way but to conclude that the petitioner was ready and willing to join service, but he was not permitted to do so without due authority of law.
Let the Writ be drawn up accordingly, expeditiously.
18. Let the xerox copy of the letter written by the Headmaster of the School to the petitioner dated 12.7.89 and the unopened envelope along with the acknowledgement card, filed in Court today, by the learned Advocate for the Managing Committee, be kept with the record.
Let xerox copy of this order be given to the learned Advocates for the parties on usual terms.

Coram:       Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajesh Bindal


Present:     Mr. R. S. Chahar, Advocate, for the appellants.
Mr. Lokesh Sinhal, Additional Advocate General, Haryana.
Rajesh Bindal J.
The landowners are in appeal before this court against the award of
the learned court below passed under
Section 18
of the Land Acquisition Act,
1894 (for short, 'the Act') seeking enhancement of compensation for the acquired
land.
Briefly, the facts of the case are that the State of Haryana vide
notification dated 10.1.1983 issued under
Section 4
of the Act, acquired the land
situated in revenue estate of Village Jharsa, Tehsil and District Gurgaon, for the
development and utilisation of land as residential, commercial and industrial area
at Gurgaon. The Land Acquisition Collector assessed the market value of the land
at Rs. 60,000/- per acre for chahi, Rs. 50,000/- per acre for magda and Rs. 40,000/-
per acre for gair mumkin kind of land. On reference under
Section 18
of the Act,
the learned court below vide award dated 14.9.1991, determined the market value
of the acquired land @ Rs. 136/- per square yard upto depth of 10 yards from the
National Highway No. 8 and @ Rs. 68/- per square yard for the rear portion
beyond the said depth.
Learned counsel for the parties do not dispute that the claim made in
the appeal is squarely covered by judgment of this court in R. F. A. No. 2 of 1991
Azad Singh vs The State of Haryana and another, decided on 30.9.1997, whereby
award of the Reference Court was upheld. The amount of compensation assessed
in the present case is also in the same terms. Accordingly, the claim made in the
appeal does not survive.
For the reasons recorded in Azad Singh's case (supra), the present
appeal is dismissed.

ORDER
K. Jayachandra Reddy J.
1. The question involved in this appeal is; what is the meaning of "Banker's lien" in the legal terminology and how it is understood and exercised in the banking system. The appellant is Syndicate Bank. The firm by the name of M/s. Jullundur Body Builders, respondent No. 2 (hereinafter referred to as "Judgment-debtor") have been enjoying various types of credit facilities from the appellant Bank for the last so many years. They were also enjoying overdraft facility with a limit of Rs. 1,00,000/-. Respondent No. 1 (hereinafter referred to as 'Decree-holder" obtained a decree against the Judgment-debtor for Rs. 1,04,441.35 p. with future interest @ 9%. In the course of the execution proceedings the Judgment-debtor agreed to pay the decretal amount in the instalments of Rs. 5,000/- per month. To ensure compliance with the undertaking, the Judgment-debtor was required by the executing court to furnish a Bank guarantee for a sum of Rs. 90,000/- in favour of High Court of Delhi. On 10.9.80 the Judgment-debtor requested the appellant Bank to furnish a Bank guarantee for a sum of Rs. 90,000/- in favour of Registrar of High Court of Delhi. The Bank agreed to furnish the Bank guarantee on the condition that the Judgment-debtor should deposit the entire sum of Rs. 90,000/-as security for the guarantee with the Bank. Or. 17.9.80 respondent No. 3, partner of the Judgment-debtor firm deposited by way of two Fixed Deposits Receipts ("FRDs" for short) of Rs. 65,000/- and Rs. 25,000/- respectively after duly discharging them by signing on the reverse of each FDR. The FDRs were to mature on 17.12.83 and 1.7.85 respectively. The two covering letters were also executed on the Bank's usual printed forms on 17.9.80. As per the recital in the said letters the Judgment-debtor agreed that the deposits and renewals shall remain with the Bank so long as any amount on any account is due to the Bank from them i.e. M/s. Jullundur Body Builders. Thereafter the Bank issued a guarantee for a sum of Rs. 90,000/- in favour of Registrar of the High Court. On 27.10.80 a Division Bench of the High Court discharged the Bank guarantee by an order passed in an appeal preferred by the Judgment-debtor.Thus on that date the Bank guarantee stood discharged and the original Bank guarantee was returned to the appellant Bank. The Decree-holder made an interlocutory application in the pending execution petition for attachment of a sum of Rs. 35,OOO/- out of Rs. 90,000/- deposited as security for the Bank guarantee on the ground that the same belongs to the Judgment-debtor and therefore is liable to be attached. A learned Single Judge of the High Court made an order of attachment on 21.11.80. The counsel for Decree-holder addressed a letter to the appellant Bank that the said attachment has been made in execution of the decree. On 4.2.81 the appellant Bark appeared before the Court and raised objection against the attachment. On 5.3.81 the High Court passed an order rejecting the objection and directed the appellant Bank to deposit a sum of Rs. 35,000/- in the Court. Against the said order, the appellant Bank has filed the present appeal.
2. It was contended before us that the appellant Bank has a banker's lien over the amount deposited by the Judgment-debtor who is their client and as Bankers they have a right to hold the security in respect of overdraft amount and therefore the attachment cannot be sustained. A similar contention was raised before the learned Single Judge but the learned Single Judge held that these two FDRs were deposited with the Bank as security for the Bank guarantee and when it was discharged the sum covered by the two FDRs belonged to the Judgment-debtor and the Bank cannot have a general lien on the security given for the Bank guarantee and in such cases it is only a case of particular lien and not a case of general lien and therefore the amounts covered by the two FDRs could be attached.
3. Shri P.P. Rao, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant Bank submitted that the letters executed on 17.9.80 by the Judgment-debtor at the time of deposit of the FDRs, clearly gave the authority to the Bank to retain the deposits "so long as any amount on any account" is due from the Judgment-debtor and therefore the Banker has a lien or a right to set off in respect of the deposits in as much as on the relevant date there was a larger liability due to the Bank. It is also his contention that on account of discharge of the Bank guarantee,the appellant Bank had a right to set off the amount in deposits against the liability of the Judgment-debtor due to the Bank. He also canvassed that the Banker's lien is legally recognised and it is of great importance to the entire Banking community and such a lien cannot be interfered with unless the liability in respect of which the lien is created, is fully discharged.
4. To appreciate these contentions it becomes necessary to refer to some of the relevant documents and then examine the meaning and scope of the expressions "Banker's lien" and "Bank guarantee" in the light of some settled principles.
5. The two FDRs were duly discharged by signing on the reverse of each of them by the Judgment-debtor and were handed over alongwith two covering letters on the Bank's usual printed forms on 17.9.80 at the time of obtaining the guarantee. The relevant clause of the letter reads as under:
The Bank is at liberty to adjust from the porceeds covered by the aforesaid Deposit.Receipt/Certificate or from proceeds of other receipts/Certificates issued in renewal thereof at any time without any reference to us, to the said loan/OD account.We agree that the above deposit and renewals shall ramain with the Bank so long as any amount on any account is due to the Bank from us or the said M/s. Jullundur Body Builders singly or jointly with others.
To the same effect is the other letter. The above recital in the letter clearly go to show that a general lien is created in favour of the appellant Bank in respect of those two FDRs, The Bank is given the authority to retain the FDRs so long as any amount on any account is due from the Judgment-debtor. Thus the appellant Bank had a right to set off in respect of these FDRs if there was a liability of the Judgment-debtor due to the Bank. In this context it is useful to refer to some passages in the text-books on the scope and meaning of the expression "banker's lien".
6. In Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol.20, 2nd Edn.p.552, para 695, lien is defined as follows:
Lien is in its primary sense is a right in one man to retain that which is in his possession belonging to another until certain demands of the person in possession are satisfied. In this primary sense it is given by law and not by contract.
In Chalmers on Bills of Exchange, Thirteenth Edition Page 91 the meaning of "Banker's lien" is given as follows:
A banker's lien on negotiable securities has been judicially defined as "an implied pledge."A banker has, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, a lien on all bills received from a customer in the ordinary course of banking business in respect of any balance that may be due from such customer."
In Chitty on Contract, Twenty-sixth Edition, Page 389, Paragraph 3032 the Banker's lien is explained as under:
By mercantile custom the banker has a general lien over all forms of commercial paper deposited by or on behalf of a customer in the oridinary course of banking business. The custom does not extend to valuables lodged for the purpose of safe custody and may in any event be displaced by either an express contract or cirumstances which show an implied agreement inconsistent with the lien.... The lien is applicable to negotiable instruments which are remitted to the banker from the customer for the purpose of collection. When collection has been made the proceeds may be used by the banker in reduction of the customer's debit balance unless otherwise earmarked.
(emphasis supplied)

 

In Paget's Law of Banking, Eighth Edition, Page 498 a passage reads as under;
THE BANKER'S LIEN

 

Apart from any specific security, the banker can lock to his general lien as a protection against loss on loan or overdraft or other credit facility. The general lien of bankers is part of law merchant and judicially recognised as such.
In Brandao v. Barnett, (1846)12 Cl. and Fin.787 it was staled as under:
Bankers most undoubtedly have a general lien on all securities deposited with them as bankers by a customer, unless there be an express contract, or circumstances that show an implied contract, inconsistent with lien.
The above passages go to show that by mercantile system the Bank has a general lien over all forms of securities or negotiable instruments deposited by or on behalf of the customer in the ordinary course of banking business and that the general lien is a valuable right of the banker judicially recognised and in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, a Banker has a general lien over such securities or bills received from a customer in the ordinary course of banking business and has a right to use the proceeds in respect of any balance that may be due from the customer by way of reduction of customer's debit balance. Such a lien is also applicable to negotiable instruments including FDRs which are remitted to the Bank by the customer for the purpose of collection. There is no gainsaying that such a lien extends to FDRs also which arc deposited by the customer.
7. Applying these principles to the case before us we are of the view that undoubtedly the appellant Bank has a lien over the two FDRs. In any event the two letters executed by the Judgment-debtor or 17.9.80 created a general lien in favour of the appellant Bank over the two FDRs. Even otherwise having regard to the mercantile custom as judicially recognised the Ranker has such a general lien over all forms of deposits or securities made by or on behalf of the customer in the ordinary course of banking business. The recital in the two letters clearly creates a general lien without giving any room whatsoever for any controversy.
8. The High Court, however, found that the two FDRs were given only by way of securities for the Bank guarantee and when once the guarantee is discharged, the amounts covered by the said two FDRs would belong to the Judgment-debtor since the charge is limited to the amount of the Bank guarantee. The High Court, in this context relied on the words "Lien to BG 11/80" which are found on the back of each FDR and according to the High Court in view of this endorsement, the Bank has no right to hold the security in their own favour after the Bank guarantee has been released and they are bound to return it to the customer namely the judgment-debtor when he makes a demand on the Bank. The High Court also observed that the terms of the Contract namely furnishing FDRs as security for the bank guarantee are inconsistent with the general lien that the Bank claims and the Bank can claim only a particular lien for the bank guarantee. It also observed that since the Bank guarantee has been discharged, the Bank has no right to hold the security for something more than what was agreed upon. We are unable to agree with this reasoning. As already noticed, the recital in the covering letters as extracted above clearly established that a general lien was created in favour of the Bank on the two FDRs. Merely because the two FDRs were also furnished as security for the issuance of the bank guarantee, the general lien thus created cannot come to an end when the Bank guarantee is discharged. The words "Lien to BG 11/80" do not make any difference.
9. In this context it becomes necessary to examine the meaning and scope of a Bank guarantee and the respective rights created thereunder.
10. It is in common parlance that the issuance of guarantee is what that a guarantor creates to discharge liability when the principal debtor fails in his duty and guarantee is in the nature of collateral agreement to answer for the debt. It is well-settled that the Bank guarantee is an autonomous contract and imposes an absolute obligation on the Bank to fulfill the terms and the payment in the Bank guarantee becomes due on the happening of a contingency on the occurrence of which the guarantee becomes enforceable.
11. The Guarantee has been defined in Halsbury's Laws of England Vol.20, Fourth Edn. page 49 para 101 as that'' A guarantee is an accessory contract whereby the promisor undertakes to be answerable to the promisee for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person whose primary liability to the promise must exist or be contemplated.
12. In the banking system it is understood that Bank guarantee has an dual aspect. In the case of a Bank guarantee the banker is the promisor. It is a contract between the Bank and the beneficiary of the guarantee and it is also a security given to the beneficiary by a third party. Now, it is a well-known business transaction in the World of commerce and it has become the backbone of the banking system. Now coming to its enforceability the same depends upon the terms under which the guarantor has bound himself. He cannot be made liable for more than what he has undertaken. Therefore the Bank guarantee, as alredy
noticed, is in the nature of a special contract depending upon the happening of a specific event and when once it is discharged the guarantee comes to an end. It has to be borne in mind that the obligations arising under the Bank guarantee arc independent of the obligations arising out of a specific contract between the parties. Therefore the endorsement of the words "Lien to BG 11/80" cannot have a bearing on the. banker's lien on the two FDRs. Merely because on the basis of the security of the two FDRs the appellant Bank gave a guarantee it cannot be said that the banker had only a limited particular lien and not a general lien on the two FDRs. In our view this finding of the High Court is erroneous.
13.
In this context it is also necessary to consider the extent to which the Court can go into the nature of the securities offered for the Bank guarantee in the light of the banker's lien.In
United Commercial Bank v. Bank of India and Ors.
this Court referred to a passage from R.D. Harbottle (Mercantile) Ltd. and Anr. v. National Westminster Bank and Ors. (1977) 2 All ER 862 with approval which runs as under:
It was only in exceptional cases that the courts would interfere with the machinery of irrevocable obligations assumed by banks. They were the life blood of international commerce. The machinery and commitments of banks were on a different level. They must be allowed to be honoured, free from interference by the courts. Otherwise trust in internal commerce could be irreparably damaged.
In R.D. Harbottle (Mercantile) Ltd. case it was stated in the Headnote as under:
(i) Only exceptional cases would the courts interfere with the machinery of irrevocable obligations assumed by banks. In the case of a confirmed performance guarantee, just as in the case of a confirmed letter of credit, the bank was onl concerned to ensure that the terms of its mandate and confirmation had been complied with and was in no way concerned with any contractual disputes which might have arisen between the buyers and sellers....
The above passage has also been referred in
U.P. Cooperative Federation Ltd. v. Singh Consultants and Engineers (P) Ltd.
wherein this Court held that the aforesaid represents the correct state of the law. In this case, this Court has affirmed the obligation of payment without dispute by the Bank in the Indian context in cases relating to Bank guarantees. But it is equally obvious that the same liability or obligation on the part of the Bank will not be there when the Bank guarantee is discharged and this needs no emphasis.
14. From the above discussion it can be gathered that the Bank guarantees are on different level and they must be allowed to be honoured free from interference by the courts and a Bank which gives a guarantee must honour the same according to its terms and it is only in exceptional cases that the court will interfere with the machinery of irrevocable obligations assumed by the banks. Afortiori the same principle applies in respect of Bank guarantees which are discharged. When once the Bank guarantee is discharged the obligation of the Bank ends and there is no question of going behind such discharged Bank guarantee. The court should refrain from probing into the nature of the transactions between the Bank and the customer which led to the furnishing of the Bank guarantee.
15. Now the next question is whether the FDRs which are with the Bank and on which the Bank claims a general lien can be attached. So far as the attachment is concerned, the banker's lien cannot by itself be a bar for such attachment. In para 89 of Vol.3 of Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edn. the law is stated as under:
For the purpose of satisfying a High Court or country court judgment for the payment of money,any sum standing to a person's credit in a deposit account in a bank is deemed to be a sum due or accruing due to that person, and to be attachable accordingly, notwithstanding that any condition applying to the account requiring that, before withdrawal, notice be given, or personal application be made, or a deposit book or a receipt for money deposited by produced, has not been satisfied.
From this it follows that if a deposit is payable at a future date or after the lapse of a Specified time it is still liable to attachment. What is attached is the money in the deposit account. The banker as a garnishee, when an attachment notice is served, has to appear before the court and obtain suitable directions for safeguarding its interest. This also become clear from the perusal of Order 21 Rule 46(a) of the Civil Procedure Code. The court, in such a situation has to take into account the banker's lien over the securities or deposits regarding which garnishee notice is issued.
16. We have already held that the appellant Bank has a general lien over those two FDRs. The High Court having held that the two FDRs can be attached gave a further direction dismissing the objection of the Bank that the Bank should deposit an amount of Rs. 35,000/-. As rightly contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant Bank, the Bank in the instant case has the liberty to adjust from the proceeds of the two FDRs towards the dues to the Bank and if there is any balance left that will only be the amount which would belong to the depositor namely the Judgment-debtor in this case and only such amount, if any, can be attached in discharge of a decree. It is also submitted that the liability of the Judgment-debtor to the appellant Bank was far in excess of the amounts covered by the two FDRs and therefore nothing is due from the Bank to the Judgment-debtor. This is a matter for verification. However, in the view taken by us above namely that the Bank has a general lien over the two FDRs we set aside the order of the High Court directing the appellant Bank to deposit an amount of Rs. 35,000/-. The High Court shall, however, consider the objections raised by the Bank, namely that no amounts are due to the Judgment-debtor, in the light of the above principles
laid down by
us and then decide whether there is any amount left for being attached by the Decree-holder in execution of his decree. With the above directions the appeal is accordingly allowed. In the circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.

04.   13.9.2010
Having heard learned senior counsel for the petitioner

                   and learned counsel for the State, this Court is not inclined to

                   interfere with the order passed against the petitioner imposing

                   certain punishment which stands substantially diluted       by the

                   appellate authority. It cannot be said that no charge was being made

                   out   against the petitioner   for being imposed punishment in

                   question.
Learned counsel for the petitioner    submits that the

                   earlier imposition of punishment is coming in the way of

                   petitioner's promotion.
This Court has reservation on such a submission
2
because effect of such punishment can only occupy the field for

      the period of three years since none of the punishment can be said

      to   be major punishment as would be evident      from the order

      passed by the appellate authority.
The writ application is dismissed with observation as

      above.

Madhya Pradesh High Court
National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs Savitri Bai Alias Vaishakhia Bai And ... on 15 February, 1990
Equivalent citations: 1991ACJ540
JUDGMENT
 

S.K. Seth, J.
1. One Santaram Satnami was stated to have died in a motor accident. In the claim for compensation made by the claimant-respondent Nos, 1 to 3, the respondent No. 4 was joined as the owner and the appellant was joined as the insurer of the vehicle. During the pendency of the proceedings, the Tribunal, vide its order dated 24.4.1989, directed the respondent No. 4 and the appellant jointly to pay an amount of Rs. 15,000/- to the claimants-respondents as interim compensation for the death of Santaram under
Section 92-A
of the Motor Vehicles Act. It is being aggrieved by the said order that the insurer-appellant has filed the present Misc. Appeal in this court.
2. Now, it is not in dispute that Santaram had died as a result of a motor accident and that the claimant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were his legal representatives. It is also not in dispute that the respondent No. 4 was the owner of the vehicle which was involved in the accident. In these circumstances, the liability of an owner to pay interim compensation under
Section 92-A
of the Motor Vehicles Act being a 'no fault liability', no mistake could be found with the Tribunal having held the respondent No. 4 liable to pay compensation under the said provisions to the claimants-respondents.
3. In fact, the real question which arises for consideration in the present appeal is whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the insurer-appellant could be held jointly liable along with the owner of the vehicle, i.e., respondent No. 4 to pay the abovesaid amount of compensation under
Section 92-A
of the Act to the claimants-respondents. In the said connection, it is significant to note that it is not in dispute that the insurance policy issued by the insurer-appellant in favour of the respondent No. 4 covered the liability to payment of interim compensation under
Section 92-A
of the Act also. What is contended on behalf of the insurer-appellant is that at the relevant time, i.e., at the time of the accident the vehicle in question was being used in direct breach of conditions contained in the insurance policy and as such the insurer-appellant could not be held jointly liable along with the owner of the vehicle to pay the amount of compensation under
Section 92-A
of the Act to the claimants-respondents.
4. In the opinion of this court, it cannot be disputed that under the provisions of the
Motor Vehicles Act
there are certain statutory defences open to an insurer on the basis of which in spite of there being an insurance policy issued by it being in operation at the relevant time it can still avoid not only its final liability but also its liability to pay interim compensation under
Section 92-A
of the Act in a claim case. But, then, needless to say, in all such cases the burden lies on the insurer to plead the relevant statutory defences and to prove the same to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. In fact, it is the said aspect of the matter which creates difficulty in determining the joint liability of the insurer at the stage of payment of interim compensation under
Section 92-A
of the Act.
5. Now, it does not require much argument to appreciate that if the insurer-appellant has to be offered an opportunity to adduce evidence in support of the statutory defence or defences raised by it at the stage of payment of interim compensation under
Section 92-A
of the Act, the procedure adopted is bound to be a time-consuming one and is likely to defeat the very purpose for which the said section has been enacted. Accordingly, bearing in mind the object of enacting
Section 92-A
of the Act, it is but fair not to adopt such a procedure at the stage of the said section. At the said stage, if the Tribunal is prima facie satisfied from the material on record that the vehicle which was involved in the accident belonged to the party who is joined as the owner of the vehicle and that the said owner has an insurance policy in his favour covering his liability to pay interim compensation under
Section 92-A
of the Act, the said facts should be regarded as sufficient by the Tribunal for directing both the owner of the vehicle and the insurer jointly to pay the amount of interim compensation under the said section to the claimant.
6. From what has been stated above, it should not be inferred that the insurer has to be denied the right to plead and establish the statutory defences, if any, available to it under the provisions of the Act and contend that in the facts and circumstances of the case it is neither liable to pay the final amount of compensation nor the interim amount of compensation under
Section 92-A
of the Act. What is really meant is that the trial of such defence/defences has to be postponed to be held along with the other issues framed in the claim case and that if the insurer is successful in establishing any such defence/defences, the owner of the vehicle is to be held liable to reimburse the said amount to the insurer in the final award to be made by the Tribunal.
7. In the opinion of this court, in view of the abovesaid legal position, no fault can be found with the Tribunal having held the insurer-appellant jointly liable along with the owner of the vehicle to pay the amount of interim compensation to the claimants-respondents at the stage of
Section 92-A
of the Act in the claim case in question. The impugned order does not deprive the insurer-appellant to plead whatever defences might be available to it under the
Motor Vehicles Act
and establish that it is not liable to pay the amount of interim compensation under
Section 92-A
of the Act. As mentioned above, if it is successful in establishing the relevant statutory defences, it shall be entitled to obtain a direction against the owner of the vehicle for the reimbursement of the amount of interim compensation, if any, recovered from it.
8. For the reasons stated above, there is no merit in the appeal. The same is accordingly dismissed with costs. Counsel's fee Rs. 250/-.
